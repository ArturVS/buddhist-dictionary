## Abstract

Goals
Importance and motivation
- Esoteric Buddhism is an important belief system
- Important historical, cultural, and language influences and connections between India, China, Japan, Tibet, and other countries

My goals
- Building a bibliographical guide for the Esoteric Section of the Taishō
- Building a bibliographic guide and digital aid to exploring the texts including English titles, short summary, and other notes for each text
- Discovering the origin of a large number of works in the Taishō that were not from the Korean canon

## Introduction

Set of texts in volumes 18-21

Points of interest
- Origin: How did they into the canon?
- Translators: When and who translated, compiled, or narrated them?
- Importance: cultural influence, historic and religious importance
- Content: What is the content of the texts?
- Structure: How are the texts structured?
- Genre: What is the style of literature and literary devices?
- Characters: Who are the figures in the texts?
- Describing them: How can the texts be described?

The texts included in the Esoteric Section of the Taishō describe details of the iconography captured in magnificent Buddhist artwork. In addition, through their description of Sanskrit chanting they have great linguistic value. Beyond this, Orzech, Payne, and Sørensen (2011, p. 18) the texts have great religious significance and support a culture of esoteric Buddhsim culture that has pervasive cultural influence in East Asia.

The 密教部 Esoteric Section of the Taishō includes 573 works contained in Volumes 18-21 (T 848 - T 1420) out of 2184 titles in volumes 1-55. The dedicated section given to esoteric texts in the Taishō is a feature of the classification system introduced in compiling the Taishō (Wilkinson 2015, p. 316). The Esoteric Section is also the largest of the 31 sections of the Taishō in terms of number of titles (Giebel 2011, p. 27). Although the Taishō was based on the Goryeo canon, based on a comparative index by Lancaster (2004) many of the esoteric texts included in the Taishō and not found in the Goryeo canon. Besides the texts by Japanese authors, there are over 400 titles in the Taisho that are not included in the Goryeo canon (Li and He 2015, pp. 337-340). 


Although the Taishō was based on the Goryeo canon, it also introduced new features, some of which had forerunners in modern Japanese Buddhism. The 縮刷藏經 Shukusatsu zōkyō version, also called the 弘教藏 Kokyo edition, of the canon was produced in Japanese between 1877 and 1885 (He Mei 2020, pp. 152-154). This version first introduced the Esoteric Section as a separate division of the canon (Li 2020, pp. 68-73). Esoteric texts had already appeared as a separate genre in the Song with the category 大乘經藏秘密部 ‘Esoteric Section of the Mahayana Canon’ in the 大中祥符法寶錄 Catalogue of the Dharma Treasure Compiled in the Dazhong Xiangfu Period (Orzech 2011d, p. 426). However, the Korean Canon was based on an earlier catalog.

There are over 140 titles in the Esoteric section in the Taisho not included in the Goryeo canon. Many of these texts contain Siddham characters that typesetting may not have existed for.

## Historic Background

Esoteric Buddhism and Tantrism in South Asia was a spectrum of forms of Buddhism fused with indiginous beliefs and practices. Esoteric Buddhism largely derives from Vedic tradition but there were also some elements of, such as dhāraṇīs, in early Indian Buddhism (Nakamura 1987, pp. 313-314). It matured at a time of shifting social structure in South Asia following the collapse of the Gupta Empire (4th-6th century).  Buddhism fused with indiginous beliefs in Northern India. Spiritual devotion was expressed in flourishing literature and art over the period 500-1200. Rituals were developed for the ruling elites. Tantrism in India includes a number of elements reflecting Indian kinship and royalty (Powers 2007, pp. 254-255). These forms tended to emphasize Prajñāpāramitā in preference to earlier teachings in the Āgama and Buddhist philosophy, such as the Buddhist logic of Candrakīrti (Davidson 2011, p. 19-24).

The Chinese classification of schools, includes the 密宗 Esoteric School as one of the 八宗 eight schools of East Asian Buddhism. Esoteric texts are thought to have been first brought to China in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The emergence of an Esoteric School is traced to the 8th century in the Tang dynasty the teachings and translations of 善無畏 Śubhakarasiṃha (637-735), 金剛智 Vajrabodhi (671-741), and Amoghavajra, the 開元三大士 ‘three great sages of Kaiyuan’ (Goble 2019, pp. 11-21). Historic proponents argued that, “It can be said that there are the Three Vehicles and also an Esoteric Vehicle,” from Yi Xing (683-727) in the 大毘盧遮那成佛經疏 “Commentary on the Vairocana Sutra” (Lü 2017, pp. 74; T 1796, Scroll 9, 39.0671a07). In addition, the Japanese tradition drew a distinction between 正純密教 seijun mikkyō ‘pure esoteric’ Buddhism and 雜部密教 zōbu mikkyō ‘mixed esoteric’ Buddhism. Goble debates whether there was really a distinct Esoteric School in China or a loose network of individuals centered around Amoghavajra and ritual practices.

Amoghavajra was a prolific translator. Over 70 translations in the Taisho are attributed to Amoghavajra, more than any other translator with the exception of Xuan Zang (Goble 2019, p. 18). The assistance that Amoghavajra received from the imperial court may have helped in this translation effort considerably. Amoghavajra assured the imperial court that these would safeguard the state (Goble 2019, pp. 213-215).

However, the imperial court establishment did not always look favorably on esoteric ritual practices, grouping them with black magic performed by rogues (Goble 2019, pp. 123-137). Emperor Dezong (742-805) especially looked down on shamanic sourcers and stopped some of their practices (Goble 2019, pp. 232-234).

Translation of sutras from Sanskrit was interrupted with the fall of the Tang and re-established under the Song. Emperor 太祖 Taizu (reigned 960–976) established the 傳法院 Institute for the Propagation of the Dharma for translation of sutras and the 印經院 Institute for Printing Sutra for printing (Orzech 2011c, p. 440). By this time esoteric Buddhism had become the dominant form of Buddhism in India and was reflected in the makeup of the translation team and selection of sutras translated. Danapala (d. 1018) was the most prolific translator of this period. His translations include many of the longer works in the Esoteric Section, including 佛說一切如來真實攝大乘現證三昧大教王經 Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁgraha (T 882) in 30 scrolls, expanded from the 3 scrolls in translator by Amoghavajra in the Tang ( T 865).

Although the Esoteric Section in the Taishō is a feature of the new classification system, it had some precedent. The 大中祥符法寶錄 ‘Catalogue of the Dharma Treasure Compiled in the Dazhong Xiangfu Period’ included a section called 大乘經藏秘密部 ‘Esoteric Portion of the Mahāyāna Scriptural Collection’ (Orzech 2011a, p. 11).

Buddhism is thought to have been broad to Japan around 538 by way of Korea (Matsuo 2007, p. 16). Not long after that Prince Shōtoku (574-622) gave Buddhism promotion by the imperial family. Early texts were brought to Japan by  道昭 Dōshō (629–700) who studied under Xuan Zang and founded the Hossō School, a version of the Faxiang School, in Japan (Beghi 2011, p. 661-674). Subsequently, 道慈 Dōji (675–744) and 玄昉 Gembō (d. 746) and others brought more texts. A 寫經所 Shakyōjo Sutra Transcription Office was established under Empress Kōmyō (701-760) aiming to transcribe the texts in the Kaiyuan Catalog (T 2154).

The Japanese monastics 最澄 Saichō (767-833) and 空海 Kukai (774–835) were two of the key figures to bring esoteric Buddhism from China to Japan. When Saichō returned to Japan he brought back texts. The esoteric texts brought back by Saichō are listed in 傳教大師將來越州錄 Dengyōdaishi shōrai esshūroku (T 2160). In 805 the Japanese imperial court ordered the texts copied and distributed to the seven great temples of Nara (Groner 2000, p. 65).

In Japan Esoteric Buddhist school is known as the Shingon school, which Kūkai was the founder of. After Kūkai returned to Japan he presented the emperor with 御請來目録 Shōrai Mokuroku ‘A Memorial Presenting a List of Newly Imported Sutras and Other Items.’ The list of 142 titles were a collection of mostly esoteric texts, including 42 works in Sanskrit, 32 commentaries and treatises, mandalas and other pictures, and ritual implements (Hakeda 1972, pp. 140-150; T 2161).  Saichō founded the Japanese Tendai school and also practiced esoteric Buddhism. 

Esoteric School is similar in many elements but a separate tradition from the Vajrayana School of Tibetan Buddhism, which emerged later than the Japanese Shingon school. However, there is some overlap in the Esoteric Section, for example with the 大悲空智金剛大教王儀軌經 Dabei Kong Zhi Jingang Da Jiao Wang Yi Gui Jing Hevajratantra (T 892), which is an important text in the Tibetan tradition.

The development of the Taishō canon took place between the Meiji and Second World War during which modernization and Japanese nationalism were emphasized. This may have influenced the creators of the canon to both base their work on modern scholarship and also include a large amount of material either written in Japan or with a Japanese connection (Wilkinson 2015, pp. 304-330; Deal and Ruppert 2015, pp. 209-219). This historic background may be one of the factors influencing the inclusion of such a large number of esoteric texts not found in the Goryeo canon.

Notes on the sources of the texts can be found in the Taishō footnotes. I have translated many of these and added them to the bibliographic notes under individual texts.

## Content

Elements of esoteric Buddhist practice include recitation of 咒 mantras or 陀羅尼 dhāraṇī [examples], drawing of 曼荼羅 maṇḍala and other, ritual symbols expressed with 手印 mudras, focus on specific deities such as 大日 Vairocana, with the goal of Buddhahood. In addition, many dhāraṇīs, such as those in Miscellaneous Collection of Dhāraṇīs (T 1336) are for other spiritual and secular goals including fulfilling wishes, purging sins, and curing illness (Shinohara 2014, pp. 29-32). This text also treats the supernatural, such as the 除一切顛狂魍魎鬼神陀羅尼 ‘Exorcism of all Monsters and Demons Dhāraṇī.’ Many texts include lengthy descriptions of the benefits of reciting the dhāraṇīs, including avoiding sickness and suffering, avoiding untimely deaths, preventing attack by demons, having fortunate rebirths, purging sins, and enlightenment.

Some rituals were performed with the goal of protection of the state, including fire rituals, also known as homa-siddhi. It is believed that Amoghavajra even conducted rituals to cause torment and death to the military enemies of the Tang court in a few cases, such with the ritual described in the 聖閻曼德迦威怒王立成大神驗念誦法 Recitation and Recollection Methods for Establishing the Great Divine Signs of the Wrathful King, the Sage Yamantaka (Goble 2019, pp. 123-127; T 1214).

The Esoteric Section of the Taisho describes an extensive pantheon of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and other deities. This collection of deities is depicted in artwork rich in symbolism. It includes the 五佛頂 five Buddha crowns, 金剛持 Vajradhara and other Dharma protectors, 明王 vidyarāja ‘wisdom kings’ and their consorts, twenty-two emanations of Tara, different forms of Avalokiteśvara, many other deities and symbols as well as variations in praise of their merits.  Chandra and Bunce (2002) is a useful resource describing and showing many of the deities, including the iconography and terms in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. Ten Grotenhuis (1999) explains the iconography and layout of mandalas that are described in a number of the canonical texts, such as the Vairocana Sutra (T 848). The Metropolitan Museum of Art has some of this material available online in digitized format in the Japanese Mandalas: Emanations and Avatars exhibition overview, Scroll of Mudras, Vajradhatu (Diamond Realm) Mandala, Scroll of Deities of the Diamond World Mandala, Monju Bosatsu with Eight Sacred Sanskrit Syllables, Womb World Mandala. These artifacts date to as early as the Heian period (794–1185), which overlaps with the time period of translation of the canonical texts that are the subject of this bibliography.

Giebel’s (2005) translation of the Vairocana Sutra, Hirakawa’s (1997) Buddhist Chinese-Sanskrit Dictionary (BCSD), and the Fo Guang Shan Dictionary of Buddhism (FGDB) are essential resources in negotiating the nearly overwhelming variant Chinese translations of Sanskrit terms describing this symbolism.

Representation of Siddham script in Chinese texts has been a problem that disproportionately affected esoteric texts. However, rather than a problem, the existence of Siddham in East Asian Buddhist texts has a great linguistic and religious significance. Siddham script is known as 天書 tiānshū in Chinese texts (Cheung, Martha and Lin Wusun 2014, pp. 443-446) or 梵字 fànzì, Japanese: bonji (JEBD '梵字', p. 21).

## Structure of the Esoteric Section

The Esoteric Section is structured by groups of similar texts. Giebel (2011, p. 27-36) describes the groups as:
- 大日經類 Mahāvairocana sūtra and related texts (848–864)
- 金剛頂經類 Vajraśekhara sūtra and related texts (865–892)
- 蘇悉地經類 Susuddhikara sūtra and related texts (893–907)
- 護摩儀軌 homa ritual, ritual site selection, and mandala construction (908-914)
- 受戒法類 precept ritual manuals (915–917)
- 諸佛儀軌類 ritual texts for buddhas  (918-943) 
- 諸佛頂儀軌類 Buddha crown ritual manuals (944–981)
- 諸經儀軌類 sutra ritual manuals (982–1029) 
- 諸觀音儀軌類 Avalokitesvara ritual manuals (1030–1118)
- 諸菩薩儀軌類 bodhisattva worship ritual manuals (1119–1170)
- 文殊儀軌類 Manjusri ritual manuals (1171-1198)
- 諸儀軌類 vidyārāja ritual manuals (1199–1243)
- 諸天等儀軌類 deva ritual manuals (1244–1330)
- 諸陀羅尼經類 dharani sutras (1331–1420) 


Some important dharanis and dharani collections appearing in the Taishō are
1. 七佛八菩薩所說大陀羅尼神呪經 Divine Spells and Great Dhāraṇīs Taught by the Seven Buddhas and Eight Bodhisattvas (T 1332)
2. 陀羅尼雜集 Miscellaneous Dhāraṇī Collection (T 1336)
3. 集法悦捨苦陀羅尼經 Dhāraṇī-sūtra on Collecting the Joy of the Teachings and Getting Rid of Suffering (embedded within other works)
4. 大周刊定眾經目錄 Da Zhoukan Ding Zhong Jing Mulu (T 2153)  

## Esoteric Texts and Elements in Other Sections of the Canon

There are some esoteric texts that are included in sections of the Taisho other than the Esoteric section. For example, 金剛頂經 Vajra Crown Tantra (T 241), also known as Vajraśekharasūtra, translated by Vajrabodhi in the Tang, is an important esoteric text included in Volume 8 in the 般若部 Prajñāpāramitā section of the canon. Esoteric commentaries, such as the 寶藏論 Treasure Store Treatise (T 1857), appear in later sections of the canon. Dhāraṇī are also sprinkled throughout the canon, often in conclusion of sutras, as in the Heart Sutra.

Japanese esoteric texts appear even later in the canon, following the Chinese texts. Some commentaries, such as 大日經義釋 Exegesis of the Mahavairocana Sutra (X 438), are included in the Manji.

## Characterization of Texts

There are a number of varieties of textual criticism that may be used for characterizing the texts of the Esoteric Section. The two discussed here will be form criticism and source criticism. Form criticism is an approach popularized in the study of Biblical literature at around the beginning of the 20th century by Hermann Gunkel (Campbell 2003, pp. 15-31). It focuses on the nature and structure of texts. It has been applied to analysis of storytelling and oral traditions.

Perhaps the most common structure in the Esoteric Section is the 陀羅尼經 dhāraṇī-sūtra, which gives dhāraṇī and explains its importance and context (Copp, Paul 2011, pp. 176-180). A typical structure of the dhāraṇī-sūtra is: 1. setting; 2. request for teaching; 3. dharani(s), 4. miraculous signs, such as the earth shaking and flowers falling from the sky; 5. Ritual instructions; 5. the merits of reciting the dhāraṇī; 6. more details on the ritual artifacts, such as layout of the mandala, mudras, and offerings; 7. conclusion. Large texts, such as the Vairocana sutra (T 848) and Amoghapāśakalparājasūtra (T 1092) are divided into 品 chapters and may include multiple mantras and rituals (Shinohara 2014, pp. 116-149).

For example, in 佛說七俱胝佛母心大准提陀羅尼經 Cundīdevīdhāraṇīsūtra (T 1077): the Buddha dwelt in the Anāthapiṇḍika Garden. Rather than a request for teachings, the Buddha observed that sentient beings would suffer in the future, so he taught the Cundī Dhāraṇī. The dhāraṇī follows. The merits mention that those who uphold and recite the dhāraṇī will have sins erased (80,000 times for all varieties of sins). Details of the ritual follow (Rulu 2012, pp.56-58). 

The texts make abundant use of symbolism and rhetoric. The texts have a clear performative aspect, which is demonstrated in chanting and ritual instructions. However, the purposes vary. Some purposes are related to meditative subjects. For example, in the 無量壽如來觀行供養儀軌 Rites for Contemplation of and Offerings to Amitāyus Tathāgata (T 930, tr. Orzech 2017, p. 27):

即作是思惟。以此覺花照觸如來海會。
Now think as follows: The enlightenment blossom illuminates the ocean-like assembly of Tathāgatas.

Eulogies and other words of praise are very common and lengthy. For example, in the 大乘瑜伽金剛性海曼殊室利千臂千鉢大教王經 Ocean of the Adamantine Nature of Mahāyāna Yoga, Being the Scripture of the Great King of Teachings of Mañjuśrī of a Thousand Arms and a Thousand Bowls (Giebel, Rolf W. 2011a, pp. 303-343 ; T 1177A).

Sørensen (2017, p. 59) argues that this is not all “ritual hyperbole” or rhetorical device since there is a consistent preoccupation with the quest for magic, especially spiritual empowerment.

Source criticism focuses on the sources and historical context of a text. Many items in the Esoteric texts feed source criticism: the Sanskrit origins in Chinese translation as well as Siddham script, prefaces, ritual artifacts, and a rich commentarial tradition. It has often been applied to the study of apocryphal texts. The sources and historical context of texts will be described in this work but apocryphal nature will not be discussed at length.

## Terminology

Some terminology used in titles in the Esoteric Section is summarized below:
- 經 sūtra -  a discourse or dialog, in the Esoteric Section this is always between deities in a spiritual realm often beginning by requesting teachings

- 陀羅尼 dhāraṇī, 真實、呪 mantra. Avoid ‘spell’ and ‘incantation’ so as not to confuse with European magic.
- 陀羅尼經、總持經 dhāraṇī sūtra, 真實經、呪經 Mantra sutra - explains the benefits and origin of a dharani  in dialog form.
- 悉地 siddhi
- 瑜伽 yoga
- 印 mudra, better than ‘seal’ which is often thought of as a stamp.

See Orzech, Payne, and Sørensen (2011, pp. 3-18), Orzech and Sørensen (2011, pp. 76-89), Orzech 2017, pp. 17-40, and Copp (2011, pp. 176-180) for more discussion on terminology related to esoteric Buddhist text genres.

## Sources of the Texts

Sources of texts in the Esoteric Section of the Taishō include the Ōbaku Canon, Shukusatsu daizōkyō, Dai Nippon Zokuzōkyō, , Hase-dera canon, manuscripts from Tō-ji, the Qing canon, Buzan University, and Dunhuang manuscripts.

The 黃檗版 Ōbaku Canon was published by 鐵眼道光 Tetsugen Dōkō of the Ōbaku sect in 1681. It is based on the Jiaxing Canon, which was a reprint of the Yongle Northern Ming Canon. Texts labelled as Ming canon may actually be the Ōbaku Canon (Wu 2017, pp. 3-4). For example, 金剛頂經瑜伽觀自在王如來修行法 Vajra Pinnacle Sutra Yoga Lokesvararaja Tathagata Practice Ritual has a note reading (T 932), 

＜原＞明本
Source: Ming canon

The 縮刷大藏經 Shukusatsu daizōkyō [Reduced Print Canon] is a modern Japanese canon that preceded the Taishō. 

The 大日本續藏經 Dai Nippon Zokuzōkyō ‘Supplementary Buddhist Canon’ is a modern Japanese canon that includes many important commentaries Example: T 849.

長谷寺藏本 Hasedera [temple] Hasedera is the main temple for the Shingon Buzan sect. An example from Hasedera is 九品往生阿彌陀三摩地集陀羅尼經 Nine Grades of Rebirth Amitabha Samadhi Assembly Dharani Sutra (T 933). Sometimes listed as from the 豊山大學藏本 Buzan University Canon (eg, T 962)

The 東寺 Tō-ji is a Shingon temple located in Kyoto, founded in 796. The source of a number of texts are manuscripts from the 寶菩提院 Hōbodai-in repository. For example, 淨瑠璃淨土摽 Lapis lazuli Pure Land Signs (T 929).

Notes in some texts indicate that the source is the Qing canon. For example, T 935 notes:

＜原＞清道光四年刊
Source: Published in the 4th year of the Daoguang era [1821-1850] of the Qing dynasty

The 大乘無量壽經 Mahayana Infinite Life Sutra ( (eg, T 936)) has a Taisho note indicating that it is from a Dunhuang manuscript from the Takakusu Junjirō family collection.

There are several themes that can be seen from the texts added into the Taishō that were not in the Korean canon:
- Connections with historical Japanese figures 
- Contained Siddham characters or mudras, which had linguistic and religious significance
- Described important rituals
Example: 大聖妙吉祥菩薩說除災教令法輪 Great Holy Wonderful Luck Bodhisattva Discourses on the Removal of Calamities Causing the Dharma Wheel to Turn (T 966), the primary text for the 熾盛光法 Blazing Light Ritual, a ritual to avoid disasters; one of the four great rituals of the Mountain School of the Tendai sect (JDBT s.v. 'Shijōkō', p. 293).
- Emerged since the Tang
- Hevajra Tantra (T 892), Guhya Sutra (T 897) - (Orzech 2011d, p. 426)
- Additional Chinese translations of the same Indian source text 
- Eg, 最勝佛頂陀羅尼淨除業障呪經 Sarvadurgatipariśodhanauṣṇīṣavijayadhāraṇi ‘Sūtra of the Buddha-Crown Superb Victory Dhāraṇī’ has 13 translations (T 967 to T 974F)
- Translated in the Yuan, Ming, or Qing dynasty.
For example, 聖救度佛母二十一種禮讚經 Sutra on the Twenty One Praises for the Goddess Tara (T 1108A) was translated in the Qing dynasty.

An example of a text with historic significance is the 一字頂輪王念誦儀軌 One Syllable Buddhosnisa Wheel Turning Ruler Liturgy (T 954A). A note on the sources for in the Taisho reads,

三十帖策子第五帖 Sanjūjō sakushi, 5th sheet

The Sanjūjō sakushi is a work by Kūkai and listed as one of the National Treasures of Japan (Pinte 2014, p. 4).

The text 千鉢文殊一百八名讚 Thousand Bowl Manjusri One Hundred and Eight Names Eulogy (T 1177B) is composed entirely of Siddham text. It was brought back to Japan by Kūkai in 806, kept at Ishiyama-dera (Giebel 2011a, p. 306). One of a set of Kukai’s own manuscripts of forty-two Siddham texts brought back to Japan.

## Parallels and Language Connections

Multi-language parallels and great linguistic influence
- Vairocana Sutra (T 848) exists in Chinese and Tibetan
  Original Sanskrit has been lost

Some texts have existing Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan
- Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁgraha (T 865) and Hevajra Tantra (T 892) has English translations from both Chinese and Tibetan

Some texts have parallels in more languages
- 大乘無量壽經 Mahayana Infinite Life Sutra (T 936) has versions in Sanskrit, Tibetan, Mongolian, Manchurian, and Huihu languages (Walleser 1916)

Japanese Buddhists took great interest in Siddham and it influenced the development of japanese phonetic writing systems (kana)
梵字悉曇字母并釋義 Meaning Siddham Letters (T 2701) by Kūkai

## Methodology
