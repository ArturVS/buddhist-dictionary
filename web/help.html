      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        There are number of features of the NTI Buddhist Dictionary intended to improve usability. 
        You can find definitions of modern and literary Chinese (文言文) and Buddhist words.
        You do not have to look words up one at a time in the NTI Buddhist Dictionary. You can
        simply paste an entire block of text into the input field.
        Even though Chinese text does not have spaces separating the words, you
        should be able to use the dictionary without knowing where words start or end in a text. 
        In addition, the dictionary will help you find the best word sense.
      </p>
      <a name='basic'></a>
      <h3>Basic Use</h3>
      <p>
        For basic use of the dictionary type in or cut and paste in the Chinese or English for the word
        that you are looking for and click the Search button.  
        You can enter either simplified or traditional Chinese to search on.
        If you don't get what you are looking for 
        or don't understand the results then keep reading or look at the list of Help topics above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each entry is a word sense. Words can have multiple word senses, which may also include different
        pronunciations and parts of speech (grammar). If you don't see the word sense that you are looking
        for follow the links for other word senses.
      </p>
      <a name='matches'></a>
      <h3>No matches found</h3>
      <p>
        If you do not get any matches found in your search try searching the whole block of text that you are
        studying. This mode will always find a result if the input is one or more Chinese characters because
        it will break the string of characters down into individual characters.
        At least the individual characters will have entries. See the description in the section 
        <a href='#text'>Breaking Chinese text into words</a> for more details on this mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the individual characters do not entries or if you have a word that you feel should be in the
        dictionary please let me know by sending an email to alex@chinesenotes.com.
      </p>
      <a name='text'></a>
      <h3 class='article'>Breaking Chinese text into words</h3>
      <p>
        The dictionary can help you look up individual words or all the words in a block of text.  
        Because Chinese words do not have spaces between them in sentences it can help to look up all the 
        words in the text.  Especially if you are a beginner or trying to make the jump from study to using 
        Chinese in real life it can often be hard to figure out the boundaries between the words.  
        This is where pasting a whole block of text into the dictionary search input field can help.
      </p>

      <h3>Disambiguating different senses of a Chinese word</h3>
      <p>
         Chinese is a rich language with a long history and this leads to words that have many different 
         meanings. That is, the same character or combination of characters has different meanings in 
         different contexts.  There are two different cases of this: (a) a <i>homonym</i>, where the words are 
         truly different, and (b) <i>polysemy</i>, where there a multiple related senses of the word.  
         Chinese is a little different from languages, like English, where more-or-less phonetic 
         spellings are used because the same character may have multiple different pronunciations.  
         In fact, 'spelling' does not really apply to Chinese. Determining the correct meaning for a 
         word in a particular sentence or other context is called word-sense disambiguation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The English defintitions in the dictionary are often separated by <i>/</i> characters.
        It is useful to give more than one English word describing a single Chinese word because 
        the English words themselves can have multiple meanings. In addition, words usually have
        a range of meanings and can be used in a range of contexts. So, giving several English words
        can give a sense of the range of uses of a Chinese word.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at an example, the character 是 (pinyin: shì), which is one of the most common words in 
        Chinese that most often means 'is.'  There are at least six different meanings found for this character.
        The most common word sense in modern Chinese is verb <em>is</em>. However, the most common sense in 
        literary Chinese is the pronoun <em>this</em>.
        Think of the word returned in the summary table as the word sense with the most likely best
        fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        To disambiguate between modern and literary Chinese click the use <em>Options</em> link on the
        dictionary page and select the <em>type</em> radio button.
        Because there are so many different word senses of words in literary Chinese it can be hard to pick
        the most appropriate one. 
        The other word senses can be seen by cliking on the <em>word senses</em> link.
      </p>
      <p>
        When reading an article or a book you are aware of the sense of words based on the words around them.
        The NTI Dictionary helps you in the same way although it is only a statistical selection because
        computers cannot really think like people. If you paste a block of text into the input field
        in literary Chinese mode (the default) then it will select words based on both preceding words
        and the overall most frequently used words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider another example: the word 他 (tā), which usually means <em>he</em>, the singular second person 
        masculine pronoun in modern Chinese. That is what you find in the dictionary if you do a lookup
        in modern Chinese mode. However, if you lookup the word in literary Chinese mode, you will find
        that the first definition listed is the pronoun <em>other / another</em>. However, if you 
        paste a block of text in you may get a better suggestion as the first entry. Try pasting the 
        text block 哆他伽哆夜 from the dhāranī ending the Amitabha Sutra. You will find that the 
        word sense listed first for 他 is <em>ta</em>, with the note <em>used for the sound in mantras</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dictionary does all this by basing the suggested word in the table of returned results 
        based on statistical selection compiled from a treebank. A treebank, also known as a tagged corpus, is a body of 
        text tagged for part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc). The 
        <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/tree/master/web/corpus/tagged">NTI Dictionary treebank</a> 
        is based on literary Chinese Buddhist texts. It is tagged for both part of speech and word sense. 
        There are two frequency tables: a unigram table for the overall frequency of words and a bigram
        table that records how common a word is given the word that came before it.
