      <h2>About the Dictionary</h2>
      <p>
        A Chinese-Sanskrit-English Buddhist Dictionary and linguistic tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a non-profit, open source project for use in reading and 
        analyzing Chinese and Sanskrit Buddhist texts.
      </p>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        The goals the dictionary are
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create an online dictionary that is easy to use for everybody interested in Buddhism, 
          including lay people reading Buddhist texts, students, translators, and academics.
          If you are looking at a large chunk of Chinese or Sanskrit text then this is for
          you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create electronic tools that are useful for lingustic analysis of Buddhist texts, 
          including identification of specialist Buddhist terms and comparison of 
          Chinese and Sanskrit texts.
          If your goal is to translate the Mahayana Buddhist Canon, then this website and 
          GitHub project is especially for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Share the source code and content with the general public. If you want to reuse source
          code or contribute source code or data then the GitHub project is built for you.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        What the dictionary is not includes: an encyclopedia or a glossary of Buddhist terms.
        Sorry, but there are people better qualified than me to create this. Please see the 
        <a href="dict_resources.html">Resources</a> section for some excellent resources.
        The project started out as a generic Chinese dictionary and is OK for that.
        Most of the terms in the dictionary are actually not Buddhist terms.
