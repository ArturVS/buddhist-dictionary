      <p>
        The goals the dictionary are
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create an online dictionary that is easy to use for everybody interested in Buddhism, 
          including lay people reading Buddhist texts, students, translators, and academics.
          If you are looking at a large chunk of Chinese or Sanskrit text but not sure what it means
          then this is for you. See notes on the <a href="translation_workflow.html#casual">Casual 
          use for a private translation</a> workflow on ways that you can use the web site for 
          this purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create electronic tools that are useful for lingustic analysis of Buddhist texts, 
          including identification of specialist Buddhist terms and comparison of 
          Chinese and Sanskrit texts.
          If your goal is to translate the Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka, then this website and 
          GitHub project is especially for you.  See the workflow described in the section 
          <a href="translation_workflow.html#contributor">Project team member for a publicly
