Text 原文本

時， 長老須菩提在大眾中即從座起，偏袒右肩，右膝著地， 合掌恭敬而白佛言：「希有！世尊！如來善護念諸菩薩， 善付囑諸菩薩。

From the midst of the great multitude [parṣad], Elder Subhūti then arose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, and knelt with his right knee to the ground. With his hands joined together in respect, he addressed the Buddha, saying, “How extraordinary, Bhagavān, is the manner in which the Tathāgata is skillfully mindful of the bodhisattvas, and skillfully instructs and cares for the bodhisattvas!

Subhūti (須菩提) was one of the ten foremost disciples of the Buddha and foremost in understanding of emptiness. It is appropriate that Subhūti asks the question that follows because it will lead to a discussion on emptiness. He now addresses the Buddha as the Tathāgata (如來), which literally means 'Thus Come One' and is one of the Ten Epithets of the Buddha. In the UWest Sanskrit Subhūti also addresses the Buddha as Sugata (Chinese 善逝) meaning the Immaculately Departed One. A bodhisattva (Chinese 菩薩) is a being that is on the path to enlightenment, working for the benefit of other sentient beings.

世尊！善男子、善女人， 發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心， 應云何住？云何降伏其心？」

Bhagavān, when good men [kulaputra] and good women [kuladuhitrā] wish to develop the mind of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi, how should their minds dwell? How should they pacify their minds [citta]?”

Sanskrit: āścaryaṁ bhagavan yāvadeva tathāgatenārhatā samyaksaṁbuddhena bodhisattvā mahāsattvāḥ parīnditāḥ paramayā parīndanayā| tatkathaṁ bhagavan bodhisattvayānasaṁprasthitena kulaputreṇa vā kuladuhitrā vā sthātavyaṁ kathaṁ pratipattavyaṁ kathaṁ cittaṁ pragrahītavyam ?

Subhūti is asking the fundamental question, What should do to cultivate themselves spiritually in order to acheive Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi? Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi is the Sanskrit term for supreme enlightenment. Anuttarā means supreme, Samyak means true or noble, and saṃbodhi means enlightenment. Used together this means supreme enlightenment In other words, How can someone become a Buddha themselves?

The Sanskrit text reads kulaputra, literally, 'son of a noble family' (Chinese 善男子). The ending is modified for the Sanskrit part of speech. Similarly for good women, which translates the Sanskrit kuladuhitrā, Chinese 善女人. These terms are used frequently in the Sanskrit but often simply translated into Chinese as 人 (person).

The second instance of the English word mind in this passage translates the Chinese 心, Sanskrit citta.

佛言：「善哉，善哉！須菩提！如汝所說：『如來善護念諸菩薩，善付囑諸菩薩。』 汝今諦聽，當為汝說。善男子、善女人， 發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，應如是住， 如是降伏其心。」　「唯然。世尊！願樂欲聞。」

The Buddha replied, “Excellent, excellent [sādhu sādhu], Subhūti, for it is just as you have said: the Tathāgata is skillfully mindful of the bodhisattvas, and skillfully instructs and cares for the bodhisattvas. Now listen [śṛṇu] carefully, because your question will be answered. Good men and good women who wish to develop the mind of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi should dwell thusly, and should pacify their minds [citta] thusly.” “Just so, Bhagavān. We are joyfully wishing to hear it.”

In this section the Buddha uses the term bodhisattva-mahāsattva. The Sanskrit word mahāsattva (Chinese: 摩訶薩), literally means a great being. We can understand bodhisattva-mahāsattva as a great bodhisattva. Dao Chuan writes,

Because they are concerned with all beings their thoughts are 'vast.' Because they are dedicated to liberating others, their thoughts are 'noble.' (Red Pine 2009, p 77, quoting Dao Chuan's 道川 work Jingang Jing Zhu 金剛經註)

The Buddha is delighted to answer questions from his disciples and rarely talks without being asked to answer a question.
