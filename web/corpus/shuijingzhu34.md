The text contains the following passage describing travel from Sichuan to Hubei along the Yangtze:

The Mount Yuan records read, It is more than 5,000 li from Sichuan to here. It takes 5 days to gown down but 100 days to go up. The Yangtze River flows then east to the north of Yichang County. Some branches are used as routes by non-Han Chinese, which is going uphill. The county government administers the south bank, with the great river forming the northern boundary of the county, opposing the area controlled by non_Han peoples.   袁山松曰：自蜀至此五千餘里，下水五日，上水百日也。江水又東逕宜昌縣北，分夷道、佷山所立也。縣治江之南岸，北枕大江，與夷陵對界。
