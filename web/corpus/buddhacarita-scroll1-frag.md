Summary: The passage describes Queen Māyā knowing herself when she had a sacred conception. The Queen lay peacefully on her
bed with a hundred thousand maidens waiting on her. On the eighth day of the fourth month the bodhisattva was born from
the right side of his mother's body. Bright light shone everywhere as if falling from empty space. After cultivating for
many kalpas, he knew that this would be his last life. He appeared from his mother's womb as the day breaks at sunrise.
The bodhisattva's body was golden. His mind was focused. He walked seven steps and observed the four directions.
He was bathed by two streams of water, one warm and the other cold. The devas and other beings in the air held a 
canopy over him.  Anubhāva praised him and urged him to cultivate the path to become a Buddha. All the dragon kings were
joyful. Mandarava flowers were scattered as offerings. It shook everywhere.
