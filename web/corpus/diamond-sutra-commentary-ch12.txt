<h3>Venerating the true teachings 尊重正教分</h3>
<h4>Text</h4>
「復次，須菩提！隨說是經，乃至四句偈等， 當知此處，一切世間天、人、阿修羅，皆應供養， 如佛塔廟，何況有人盡能受持讀誦。須菩提！ 當知是人成就最上第一希有之法， 若是經典所在之處，則為有佛，若尊重弟子。」

“Moreover [khalu punaḥ], Subhūti, if one speaks even a four-line gāthā from within this sūtra, you should understand that this place is like the shrine of a buddha. In every world, the devas, humans, and asuras should provide offerings to it. How much more so for those capable of accepting and maintaining the entire sūtra? Subhūti, you should know that this is a person with the highest and most exceptional Dharma. Wherever this sūtra dwells is the Buddha or an honored disciple.

<h4>Comments</h4>
The English text <em>shrine of a buddha</em> translates the Chinese 佛塔廟. Yifa uses the English term <em>Buddha Pagoda</em>. These terms often translate the Sanskrit terms stūpa or caitya. Here the Sanskrit word <em>caitya</em> is used. In his commentary on Chapter 12, Red Pine (2009) says that caitya has a broader meaning than stūpa but it appears that stūpa is intended here. Indian stūpa's typically have the shape of an inverted alms bowl, such as the Sanchi Stupa in Madhya Pradesh. Stūpa's are generally used to hold the relics of the Buddha and other important Buddhist figures. However, from the seventh century on Indian stūpa's instead contained clay tablets with four line verses. (Buswell and Lopez 2014, entry on stūpa)

Hsing Yun lists ten common ways for sharing the Diamond Sūtra with others:

1. Transcribing the sūtra
2. Making an offering of the sūtra in a temple.
3. Printing and circulating the sūtra.
4. Learning the teachings in the sūtra.
5. Explaining the sūtra to others.
6. Receiving and upholding the teachings in the sūtra.
7. Teaching the sūtra in Dhárma talks.
8. Chanting the sūtra.
9. Contemplating the sūtra.
10. Thinking about the sūtra's profound meaning.
