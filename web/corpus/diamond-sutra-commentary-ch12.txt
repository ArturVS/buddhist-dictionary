<h3>Venerating the true teachings 尊重正教分</h3>

<div class="text">「復次，須菩提！隨說是經，乃至四句偈等， 當知此處，一切世間天、人、阿修羅，皆應供養， 如佛塔廟，何況有人盡能受持讀誦。須菩提！ 當知是人成就最上第一希有之法， 若是經典所在之處，則為有佛，若尊重弟子。」

Yifa: “Furthermore Subhuti, following an explanation of this sutra, if even just four lines of verse, you should know that at this place every deva, human and asura of all worldly realms will make offerings as if it were a Buddha pagoda. How much more so if there was someone able to receive, retain, read and recite it completely?”

“Subhuti, you should know, this person achieves the supreme, foremost, rare Dharma. Wherever this scripture is located there will be a Buddha and an honorable disciple.”

Question: Isn't a Buddha Pagoda a place for keeping relics?

The English text <em>shrine of a buddha</em> translates the Chinese 佛塔廟. Yifa uses the English term <em>Buddha Pagoda</em>. These terms often translate the Sanskrit terms stūpa or caitya. Here the Sanskrit word <em>caitya</em> is used. A caitya, usually translated into Chinese as 支提, usually refers to a cairn or generally to a Buddhist shrine. (Buswell and Lopez 2014, entry on caitya) Caityas were sometimes even built inside caves. However, in pagodas were built in a Chinese architectural style so that <em>pagoda</em> is the word often used in translations from Chinese to English. In his commentary on Chapter 12, Red Pine (2009) says that caitya has a broader meaning than stūpa but it appears that stūpa is intended here. Indian stūpa's typically have the shape of an inverted alms bowl, such as the Sanchi Stupa in Madhya Pradesh. Stūpa's are generally used to hold the relics of the Buddha and other important Buddhist figures. However, from the seventh century on Indian stūpa's instead contained clay tablets with four line verses. (Buswell and Lopez 2014, entry on stūpa)
