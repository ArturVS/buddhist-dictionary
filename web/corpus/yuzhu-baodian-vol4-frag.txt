後人每二月八日巡城圍繞，四月八日行像供養，並其遺化，無廢兩存。

People of later times always circumambulate the city on the 8th day of the 2nd month, and hold a statue procession and make offerings on the 8th day of the 4th month. Both [occasions] represent the legacy of the transformation [effected by the Buddha]; neither is abandoned, both coexist.
