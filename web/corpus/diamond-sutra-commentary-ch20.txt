 Leaving form, leaving appearance 離色離相分

Text 原文本

「須菩提！ 於意云何？佛可以具足色身見不？」　「不也，世尊！如來不應以具足色身見。 何以故？如來說具足色身，即非具足色身， 是名具足色身。」

“Subhūti, what do you think? Can the Tathāgata be seen by means of the perfected body of form [rūpakāya]?” “No, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata cannot be seen by means of the perfected body of form [rūpakāya]. Why? The perfected body of form [rūpakāya] that the Tathāgata speaks of is itself not a perfected body of form [rūpakāya], and is thus called the perfected body of form [rūpakāya].”

Sanskrit: tatkiṁ manyase subhūte rūpakāyapariniṣpattyā tathāgato draṣṭavyaḥ ? subhūtirāha-no hīdaṁ bhagavan| na rūpakāyapariniṣpattyā tathāgato draṣṭavyaḥ| tatkasya hetoḥ ? rūpakāyapariniṣpattī rūpakāyapariniṣpattiriti bhagavan apariniṣpattireṣā tathāgatena bhāṣitā| tenocyate rūpakāyapariniṣpattiriti||

This section focuses on transcending form and appearances. Both are inherently empty of existence. This was mentioned in Section 5 and Section 13 but a deeper explanation is given here. The question is asked again in Section 26.

The English phrase body of form (physical body) translates the Chinese 色身, Sanskrit rūpakāya. The English word perfection translates the Chinese 具足, Sanskrit pariniṣpattyi.

「須菩提！ 於意云何？如來可以具足諸相見不？」「不也，世尊！ 如來不應以具足諸相見。何以故？如來說諸相具足， 即非具足，是名諸相具足。」

“Subhūti, what do you think? Can the Tathāgata be seen by the perfection [saṁpadā] of all marks [lakṣaṇa]?” “No, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata cannot be seen by the perfection [saṁpadā] of all marks [lakṣaṇa]. Why? The perfection of marks [lakṣaṇa] that the Tathāgata speaks of is itself not a perfection [saṁpadā], and is thus called the perfection [saṁpadā] of marks [lakṣaṇa].”

Sanskrit: bhagavānāha- tatkiṁ manyase subhūte lakṣaṇasaṁpadā tathāgato draṣṭavyaḥ ? subhūtirāha-no hīdaṁ bhagavān| na lakṣaṇasaṁpadā tathāgato draṣṭavyaḥ| tatkasya hetoḥ ? yaiṣā bhagavan lakṣaṇasaṁpattathāgatena bhāṣitā, alakṣaṇasaṁpadeṣā tathāgatena bhāṣitā| tenocyate lakṣaṇasaṁpaditi||20||

This sentence reinforces the point above. The Buddha has three bodies: an incarnated physical body, a reward body, and a dharma body. The dharma body cannot be seen by physical attributes, even though those attributes are perfectly developed. In his commentary on the Diamond Sūtra Hui Neng says,

The Buddha is concerned that beings do not see his dharma body and only see its thirty-two attributes and eighty characteristics, such as its purple, burnished glow, and think of these as the Tathagata's true body. In order to eliminate this mistake, he asks Subhūti if the Buddha can be seen by means of his perfected physical body or not.

In this passage the English word mark translates the Chinese 相, Sanskrit lakṣaṇa. The English word perfection translates the Chinese 具足, Sanskrit saṁpadā, rather than pariniṣpattyi, as in the first sentence. The word saṁpadā may be also translated as possession.
