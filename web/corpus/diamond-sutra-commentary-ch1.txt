Chapter 1. The convocation of the assembly 法會因由

Text 原文本

如是我聞

Thus have I heard

Sanskrit: evaṁ mayā śrutam|

Comments

Every sūtra spoken by the Buddha begins with this text, 'Thus have I heard.' The Buddha instructed Ananda to use these words to make it clear that he was repeating what he had heard from the Buddha (Tzu Chuang, 2012).

一時，佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園， 與大比丘眾千二百五十人俱。

Text: At one time the Buddha was in Śrāvastī, residing in the Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s park, along with a great saṃgha of bhikṣus, twelve hundred and fifty in all.

This sentence is the preface (序分) or the first part of the three parts of the sūtra. The teaching of the Dhárma requires six different elements that are known as the Six Accomplishments (六成就). These are faith (信成就), hearing (闻成就), time (时成就), teacher (主成就), location (处成就), and assembly (众成就) (Hsing Yun 2012, p 58; Jiang Wei Zhen 1941). Without any one of these elements no teaching could take place. We have faith because of the phrase 'Thus have I heard' at the beginning of the sūtra, which also includes hearing. The time is 'one time.' The teacher is the Buddha. The location is Śrāvastī, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Kosala. The Buddha spent about 25 years in Śrāvastī and delivered many sutras there (Singh, 2003). This sentence also gives some details about the sixth accomplishment, the assembly, which consists of 1,250 monks.

爾時， 世尊食時，著衣持缽，入舍衛大城乞食。

At mealtime, the Bhagavān put on his robe [cīvara], picked up his bowl [pātra], and made his way into the great city [nagarī] of Śrāvastī to beg for food [piṇḍa] within the city walls.

Sanskrit: atha khalu bhagavān pūrvāhṇakālasamaye nivāsya pātracīvaramādāya śrāvastīṁ mahānagarīṁ piṇḍāya prāvikṣat|

Begging was an accepted practice in ancient India. It was not uncommon for wandering ascetics of the Śramaṇa trdition tradition at that time to live by collecting alms (Harvey, 1990). By begging for food the Buddha showed his dependency on other members of society and that he was humble enough to do so even though he came from a priliged position in that society. The same was true of many of his followers who were Brahmins.

Here the Buddha is referred to as the Bhagavān, which literally means 'Blessed One.' The Chinese term used is 世尊, which literally means 'World Honored One.' You will see 'World Honored One' used frequently in other English translations.

於其城中， 次第乞已，還至本處。

After [paścā] he had finished begging sequentially from door to door, he returned [pratikrāmati / pratikrān] and ate his meal.

Sanskrit: atha khalu bhagavān śrāvastīṁ mahānagarīṁ piṇḍāya caritvā kṛtabhaktakṛtyaḥ paścādbhaktapiṇḍapātapratikrāntaḥ

Comments

There were rules for begging sequentially at each house. Monks had to stop at each house, had to accept what was given, and could not take more than would fit into an alms bowl.

Then he put away his robe [cīvara] and bowl [pātra], washed [prakṣālya] his feet [pāda], arranged his seat, and sat down.

This sentence emphasizes the Buddha's mindfullness of taking care of everyday things. He takes care of these things before beginning to talk. Interestingly, it also gives us a glimpse at the life that the Buddha lived in ancient India. The practice of begging for food house-to-house is an ascetic practice described in the Visuddhimagga (Buddhaghoṣa 1991). The sequence of begging for alms from house to house and returning to eat at Jeta Grove demonstrates the Six Paramitas (Hsing Yun 2012, p 43-44).
