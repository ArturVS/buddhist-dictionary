景明寺… 時世好崇福。四月七日京師諸像皆來此寺。尚書祠曹錄像。凡有一千餘軀。至八月節。以次入宣陽門。向閶闔宮前。受皇帝散花。于時金花映日。寶蓋浮雲。旛幢若林。香煙似霧。梵樂法音。聒動天地。百戲騰驤。所在駢比。名僧德眾負錫為群。信徒法侶持花成藪。車騎填咽。繁衍相傾。時有西域胡沙門。見此唱言佛國。

The Ching-Ming Monastery [Bright Prospect Monastery]… At the time, the nation liked to pray for happiness, [so] on the seventh day of the fourth month all images in the capital were assembled in this monastery, numbering more than one thousand, according to the records of the Office of Sacrifices, Department of State Affairs. On the eighth day, the images [were carried] one by one into the Hsüan-yang Gate, where the emperor would scatter flowers in front of the Ch’ang-ho Palace. At this moment, gold-colored flowers reflected the dazzling sunlight, and the bejeweled canopies [over the carriages] for the images floated in the clouds. Banners were [as numerous as trees] in a forest, and incense smoke was [as thick as] a fog. Indian music and the din of chanted Buddhist scriptures moved heaven and earth alike. Wherever variety shows [were performed], there was congestion. Renowned monks and virtuous masters, each carrying a staff, formed a throng. The Buddhist devotees and their “companions in the law” holding flowers resembled a garden in bloom. Carriages and horses choked [traffic] and jostled each other. A foreign monk from the Western Regions saw it, and he chanted and said it was [the same as the Buddha's land as he had witnessed it].
