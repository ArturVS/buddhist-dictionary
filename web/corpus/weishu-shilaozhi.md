### English translation

At that time Shih-tsu had just ascended the throne. He also, continuing the actions of T’ai-tsu and T’ai-tsung, always used to invite śramaṇas (should read 'monks') of high character and discuss with them. On the eighth day of the fourth month he used to mount the Buddha images on carriages and march them through the wide streets. The Emperor would personally drive to the gate tower and watch; he would scatter flowers and thus perform acts of veneration.
