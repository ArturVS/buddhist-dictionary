### English translation

At that time Shih-tsu had just ascended the throne. He also, continuing the actions of T’ai-tsu and T’ai-tsung, always used to invite śramaṇas (should read 'monks') of high character and discuss with them. On the eighth day of the fourth month he used to mount the Buddha images on carriages and march them through the wide streets. The Emperor would personally drive to the gate tower and watch; he would scatter flowers and thus perform acts of veneration.

Source of translation: Hurvitz (1956), p56.

This is a translation of the passage

世祖初即位。亦遵太祖太宗之業。每引高德沙門。與共談論。於四月八日。輿諸佛像。行於廣衢。帝親御門樓臨觀。散花以致禮敬。
