The five pairs of eyes refer to different states of vision through which we can see much more than our physical eyes normally can (Hsing Yun 2012, p 147-148). The five types of eyes are

Physical eyes(Chinese 肉眼, Sanskrit māṃsacakṣu): the kind of vision that people normally possess for physical sight.
Heavenly eyes (Chinese 天眼, Sanskrit divyaṃ cakṣu): possessed by heavenly beings or obtained by people through meditation. Can see all physical objects whether or not hidden by barriers, such as walls.
Wisdom eyes (Chinese 慧眼, Sanskrit prajñācakṣu): possessed by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, vision imbued with wisdom but lacks compassion.
Dhárma eyes (Chinese 法眼, Sanskrit dharmacakṣu): possessed by bodhisattvas, can adapt to different circumstances to liberate sentient beings.
Buddha eyes (Chinese 佛眼, Sanskrit buddhacakṣu): possessed by Buddhas, includes all the previous types of vision and perceives the truth of all phenomena.
The are explained in the Mahā Prajñāpāramitā Śāstra by Nāgārjuna. In his commentary on the Diamond Sūtra Vasubandu says,

Again the doubt arises, as it was previously said that bodhisattvas see no beings are those who see no self and do not see pure buddhalands, and that those who do not see any dharmas are called buddhas, someone might think buddhas and tathagatas do not see any dharmas. To resolve this doubt, the sutra brings up the five eyes.

「須菩提！ 於意云何？恆河中所有沙，佛說是沙不？」　「如是，世尊！如來說是沙。」 「須菩提！於意云何？如一恆河中所有沙， 有如是等恆河，是諸恆河所有沙數佛世界， 如是寧為多不？」「甚多，世尊！」

“Subhūti, what do you think? Regarding the sand [vālukā] grains of the Ganges [gaṅgā] River [mahānada], does the Buddha speak of these grains of sand [vālukā]?” “Thusly, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata speaks of these grains of sand [vālukā].” “If there were as many Ganges Rivers [gaṅgā] as there are sand [vālukā] grains in the Ganges River [gaṅgā], and there were such buddha world realms as there were sand [vālukā] grains in all those Ganges Rivers [gaṅgā], would their number be very many [tāvat]?” “It would be extremely many, Bhagavān.”

The Sanskrit text adds mahānada, literally great river, after gaṅgā to emphasize the great size.

佛告須菩提： 「爾所國土中，所有眾生，若干種心，如來悉知。 何以故？如來說諸心，皆為非心，是名為心。 所以者何？須菩提！過去心不可得， 現在心不可得，未來心不可得。

The Buddha told Subhūti, “Such a number of lands possess [lokadhātuṣu] a multitude of sentient beings, and their minds [cittadhārā] are fully known by the Tathāgata. Why? The minds [cittadhārā] that the Tathāgata speaks of are not minds [cittadhārā], and are thus called minds [cittadhārā]. Why is this so? Subhūti, past [atīta] mind [citta] cannot be grasped, present [pratyutpanna] mind [citta] cannot be grasped, and future [anāgata] mind [citta] cannot be grasped.

Sanskrit: bhagavānāha-yāvantaḥ subhūte teṣu lokadhātuṣu sattvāḥ, teṣāmahaṃ nānābhāvāṃ cittadhārāṃ prajānāmi| tatkasya hetoḥ ? cittadhārā cittadhāreti subhūte adhāraiṣā tathāgatena bhāṣitā, tenocyate cittadhāreti| tatkasya hetoḥ ? atītaṃ subhūte cittaṃ nopalabhyate| anāgataṃ cittaṃ nopalabhyate| pratyutpannaṃ cittaṃ nopalabhyate||18||

The Sanskrit text uses the term cittadhārā, literally mind stream but that is rendered simply as mind in English and Chinese 心. The Sanskrit text uses the word nānābhāvā (English: various, Chinese: 種) to describe the many different kinds of minds of the multitude of sentient beings (nānābhāvāṃ cittadhārāṃ). 

The Sanskrit word lokadhātuṣu is the locative case, plural form for the stem form lokadhātu, so it means "in other worlds." The Chinese word 國土 would be better translated to English as a <strong>land</strong> than a world.
