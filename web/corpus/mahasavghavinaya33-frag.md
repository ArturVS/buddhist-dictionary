### English translation

If at the sites of a Buddha’s Birthday great assembly or Bodhi great assembly, or if at a quinquennial great assembly, there are various kinds of musical entertainments staged as offerings to the Buddha; and if a dānapati [i.e. donor] says, “Revered ones, join me in following the World-honored One,” and one then sits together with him; and if while sitting, there are various kinds of musical entertainments, giving rise to defilements and attachments, then one should stand up and leave. This is what is known as entertainment music.

(Chapman 2007, p278)
