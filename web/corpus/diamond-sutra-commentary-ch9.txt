<div class="text">「須菩提！於意云何？須陀洹能作是念： 『我得須陀洹果。』不？」　須菩提言：「不也，世尊！ 何以故？須陀洹名為入流，而無所入，不入色、聲、香、味、觸、法，是名須陀洹。」

“Subhūti, what do you think? Does a Srotaāpanna have [bhavati] the thought, ‘I [mayā] have obtained [prāpta] the fruit [phala] of a srotaāpanna?’” Subhūti replied, “No, Bhagavān. Why? ‘Srotaāpanna’ refers to one who has entered [āpanna] the stream, yet there is nothing entered into. There is no entry into forms, sounds [śabda], scents [gandha], tastes [rasa], touch [spraṣṭavya], or dharmas. Thus is one called a srotaāpanna.”

In Section 7 the Buddha mentioned noble ones (Sanskrit: āryapudgala). Now he gives more details about the different kinds of noble ones.

A Srotaāpanna (Chinese 須陀洹), also called a stream (Sanskrit: srotas, Chinese: 流) enterer (Sanskrit: āpanna, Chinese: 入), has attained the first of the four stages in the Arhat path to enlightenment. The Sutra in Forty-two Sections Spoken by the Buddha says,

Prior to the Sakṛdāgāmin is the Srotaāpanna, who has seven deaths and seven births remaining, and then becomes an Arhat. [Hsuan Hua 1991, p 67]

The word fruit translates the Chinese 果, Sanskrit phala. Fruit is a frequent analogy for the result of practice. We can tell that the Sanskrit words bhavati (become) and prāptamiti (obtain) apply to the Srotaāpanna because the suffix ti indicates that they are in the third person. [Egenes 2011, p5] prāptamiti is a compound that combines prāpta (obtain) + iti (to say).

“Subhūti, what do you think? Does a Sakṛdāgāmin have the thought, ‘I have obtained the fruit of a Sakṛdāgāmin?’” Subhūti replied, “No, Bhagavān. Why? ‘Sakṛdāgāmin’ refers to one who will return once more, yet there is nothing which leaves or returns. Thus is one called a sakṛdāgāmin.”

A sakṛdāgāmin (Chinese 斯陀含) has attained the second of the four stages in the Arhat path to enlightenment. The Sutra in Forty-two Sections Spoken by the Buddha says,

Prior to the Anāgāmin is the Sakṛdāgāmin, who ascends once, returns once more, and thereafter becomes an Arhat. [Hsuan Hua 1991, p 67]

“Subhūti, what do you think? Does an Anāgāmin have the thought, ‘I have obtained the fruit of an Anāgāmin?’” Subhūti replied, “No, Bhagavān. Why? ‘Anāgāmin’ refers to one who will not return, yet there is nothing non-returning. Thus is one called an Anāgāmin.”

<div class="text">「須菩提！於意云何？阿羅漢能作是念：『我得阿羅漢道。』不？」須菩提言：「不也，世尊！何以故？實無有法名阿羅漢。世尊！若阿羅漢作是念：『我得阿羅漢道。』即為著我、人、眾生、壽者。世尊！佛說我得無諍三昧，人中最為第一，是第一離欲阿羅漢。我不作是念：『我是離欲阿羅漢。』世尊！我若作是念：『我得阿羅漢道。』世尊則不說須菩提是樂阿蘭那行者！以須菩提實無所行，而名須菩提是樂阿蘭那行。」

“Subhūti, what do you think? Does an arhat have the thought, ‘I have obtained the fruit of an arhat?’” Subhūti replied, “No, Bhagavān. Why? There is truly no dharma which may be called an arhat. Bhagavān, if an arhat has the thought, ‘I have attained the Arhat Path,’ then this is a person attached to a self, a person, a being, and a life. Bhagavān, the Buddha says that among Arhats, I am [ahamasmi] the foremost in my practice of the Samādhi of Non-contention, and am the foremost free of desire. However, Bhagavān, I do not have the thought, ‘I am [ahamasmi] an Arhat free of desire [vītarāga].’ If I were thinking this way, then the Bhagavān would not speak of ‘Subhūti, the one who dwells in peace.’ It is because there is truly nothing dwelled in, that he speaks of ‘Subhūti, the one who dwells in peace.’”

An arhat has acheived englightenment and will not return in a future life. In the Yuganaddha Sutta the Buddha says that a monk or nun becomes an arhat (Pali: arahant) by abandoning his fetters and destroying his obsessions by one of the four paths: (1) developing insight preceded by tranquillity, (2) developing tranquillity preceded by insight, (3) developing tranquillity in tandem with insight, or (4) focussing his mind steady inwardly so that it settles down, and becomes unified, and concentrated. [AN 4.170 Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.) 2010] This helps to explain why an Arhat cannot be an Arhat if she or he is attached to the notion of being an Arhat.

At the end of this passage the Chinese and Sanksrit versions mention practicing in a forest or wilderness location called araṇya in Sanskrit (Chinese: 阿蘭那). This is a peaceful and quite place suitable for a monastic to practice and live. Living or frequently practicing at an araṇya location is one of the Twelve Ascetic Practices (Chinese: 十二頭陀行), which is what is referred to in the text. [Fo Guang Shan Dictionary]

In the Sanksrit text the compound word arhattvaṃ is used four times. This is the accusative form of a compound formed from the two parts arhat + tvam (you) with sandhi applied.
