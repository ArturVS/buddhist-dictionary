大唐三藏法師菩提流支奉　詔譯
Translated by Tripiṭaka Venerable Bodhiruci in the Tang Dynasty, as an offering

[0081c12] 如是我聞：
Thus I have heard:

[0081c12] 一時佛在王舍城耆闍崛山中，與比丘眾千二百五十人、菩薩摩訶薩十千人俱。
At one time, the Buddha was joined by an assembly of one thousand two hundred and fifty monastics, as well as ten thousand great bodhisattvas, at Vulture Peak in Rajagrha.

[0081c14] 時王舍城有長者女名為妙慧，年始八歲，面貌端正，容色姝好，諸相具足，見者歡喜——曾於過去無量諸佛親近供養、種諸善根。
At that time, the daughter of an elder from Rajagrha, named Sumati, was eight years old. She had elegant, well-formed facial features and a beautiful complexion. In all other regards, she was pleasing to the eye and a pleasure to behold. This was due to the fact that, in her previous lives, she had paid homage and made offerings to all of the countless Buddhas, planting all wholesome roots.

[0081c16] 時彼女人詣如來所，頂禮佛足，右繞三匝，長跪合掌而說偈言：

「無上等正覺，　　為世大明燈。
　菩薩之所行，　　唯願聽我問。」
At that time, this young girl went to see the Tathagata. She paid homage to the Buddha, circumambulated him three times, knelt, joined her palms, and spoke in verse:
<i>Supreme Perfect Enlightened One,
Bright light of this world,
Concerning bodhisattva's practices
I hope you will allow me to ask you questions.</i>

[0081c21] 佛告妙慧：「今恣汝問，當為解說，令斷疑網。」
The Buddha said to Sumati, "Now you may ask as you please. I will explain and sever your doubts."

[0081c21] 爾時，妙慧即於佛前以偈問曰：
At that time, Sumati presented her questions to the Buddha in the form of a verse:

「云何得端正、　　大富尊貴身？
　復以何因緣，　　眷屬難沮壞？
　云何見己身，　　而受於化生，
　千葉蓮花上，　　面奉諸世尊？
　云何能證得，　　自在勝神通，
　遍往無量剎，　　禮敬於諸佛？
　云何得無怨，　　所言人信受，
　淨除於法障，　　永離諸魔業？
　云何命終時，　　得見於諸佛，
　聞說清淨法，　　不受於苦惱？
　大悲無上尊！　　唯願為我說。」
<i>How does one obtain elegant, proper form,
Wealth, and nobility?
Through what causes and conditions
Are families kept from destruction?

How can one see this body
Be reborn by transformation
Atop a thousand-petaled lotus
And make offerings to all World Honored Ones?

How can one attain
Supernatural powers, freely
Travel throughout innumerable realms,
And pay homage to all Buddhas?

How does one live blamelessly,
Ensure one's words are trusted by others,
Be pure, eliminate Dharma obstructions,
And forever leave behind all actions of Mara?

How can one, at the end of life,
See all Buddhas,
Hear the pure, pristine Dharma,
And no longer be subject to suffering?

Supremely honored one of great compassion,
I hope you will answer my questions.</i>

[0082a05] 爾時，佛告妙慧童女言：「善哉善哉，善能問此深妙之義。諦聽諦聽，善思念之，當為汝說。」
At that time, the Buddha said to Sumati, "Excellent! Excellent! It is excellent that you are able to ask about such profound teachings. Listen well! Listen well! Think well upon this as I speak to you."

[0082a06] 妙慧白言：「唯然，世尊！願樂欲聞。」
Sumati said, "Please do, World Honored One. I will joyfully listen."

[0082a08] 佛言：「妙慧！菩薩成就四法受端正身。何等為四？一者、於惡友所不起瞋心，二者、住於大慈，三者、深樂正法，四者、造佛形像。」
The Buddha said, "Sumati, bodhisattvas use four methods to attain elegant, proper form. What four? First, do not give rise to anger when dealing with unwholesome friends. Second, tranquilly abide with great loving-kindness. Third, take deep joy in the true Dharma. Fourth, make Buddha images."

[0082a10] 爾時，世尊而說偈言：

「瞋壞善根勿增長、　　慈心、樂法、造佛形，
　當獲具相莊嚴身，　　一切眾生常樂見。
At that time, the World Honored One spoke the following verse:
<i>Anger ruins wholesome roots, so they no longer grow.
Make Buddha images with a kind heart and Dharma joy.
When one obtains a body fully adorned with all the auspicious signs.
All sentient beings will delight in seeing it.
</i>

[0082a14] 「復次，妙慧！菩薩成就四法得富貴身。何等為四？一者、應時行施，二者、無輕慢心，三者、歡喜而與，四者、不希果報。」
"Once again, Sumati, bodhisattvas use four methods to obtain wealth and nobility. What four? First, give timely gifts. Second, [give] without contempt or arrogance. Third, give joyfully. Fourth, [give] with no expectation of reward."

[0082a16] 爾時，世尊而說偈言：

「應時行施、無輕慢、　　歡喜授與、不希求，
　能於此業常勤修，　　所生當獲大財位。
At that time, the World Honored One spoke a verse:
<i>Give timely gifts without contempt or arrogance.
Do so joyfully, with no expectation of reward.
Strive onwards in this manner in your constant cultivation.
Therein wealth and noble status will be obtained.
</i>

[0082a19] 「復次，妙慧！菩薩成就四法得眷屬不壞。何等為四？一者、善能棄捨離間之語，二者、邪見眾生令住正見，三者、正法將滅護令久住，四者、教諸有情趣佛菩提。」
"Once again, Sumati, bodhisattvas use four methods to keep their families from destruction. What four? First, skillfully abandon divisive language. Second, persuade sentient beings marred by wrong view to abive in right view. Third, protect and ensure to continuation of the true Dharma. Fourth, teach all senitient beings to attain Buddhahood."

[0082a22] 爾時，世尊而說偈言：

「捨離間言及邪見、　　正法將滅能護持、
　安住眾生大菩提，　　當成不壞諸眷屬。
At that time, the World Honored One spoke a verse:
<i>
Abandon devisive language and wrong views.
The true Dharma has yet to perish. It can still be protected.
Lead sentient beings to abide in great enlightenment.
When this is accomplished, everyone will be kept from destruction.</i>

[0082a25] 「復次，妙慧！菩薩成就四法，當於佛前得受化生，處蓮花座。何等為四？一者、捧諸花果及細末香散於如來及諸塔廟，二者、終不於他妄加損害，三者、造如來像安處蓮華，四者、於佛菩提深生淨信。」
"Once again, Sumati, bodhisattvas use four methods to be born by transformation in the presence of a Buddha, atop a lotus throne. What four? First, offer flowers, fruits, and powdered incense at Tathagata stupas and temples. Second, never bring harm upon others. Third, make Tathagata images and place them upon lotus thrones. Fourth, develop a pure faith in the enlightenment of all Buddhas."

[0082a29] 爾時，世尊而說偈言：

「花香散佛及支提、　　不害於他并造像、
　於大菩提深信解，　　得處蓮花生佛前。
At that time, the World Honored One spoke a verse:
<i>Spread flowers and incense over Buddhas and stupas,
Do not harm others, make Buddha images,
Have deep faith in great enlightenment,
And one will be born by transformation atop a lotus before a Buddha.</i>

[0082b03] 「復次，妙慧！菩薩成就四法，從一佛土至一佛土。何等為四？一者、見他修善不為障惱，二者、他說法時未常留礙，三者、然燈供養如來之塔，四者、於諸禪定常勤修習。」
"Once again, Sumati, bodhisattvas use four methods to travel from one Buddha land to another. What four? First, do not hinder or become angry at the sight of others cultivating wholesomeness. Second, do not impede others from speaking the Dharma. Third, light lamp offerings at Tathagata stupas. Fourth, continuously cultivate all varieties of meditative concentration."

[0082b06] 爾時，世尊而說偈言：

「見人修善、說正法，　　不生謗毀加留難，
　如來塔廟施燈明，　　修習諸禪遊佛剎。
At that time, the World Honored One spoke the following verse:
<i>When seeing others cultivate wholesomeness and speak the true Dharma,
Do not hinder their efforts or criticize them.
Offer bright lamps at Tathagata stupas and temples,
and your cultivation of meditation will bring you to Buddha lands.
</i>

[0082b10] 「復次，妙慧！菩薩成就四法處世無怨。云何為四？一者、以無諂心親近善友，二者、於他勝法無嫉妬心，三者、他獲名譽心常歡喜，四者、於菩薩行無輕毀心。」
"Once again, Sumati, bodhisattvas use four methods to live blamelessly. What four? First, make good Dharma friends without flattery. Second, do not be jealous of others' accomplishments. Third, when others achieve fame, be happy for them. Fourth, while cultivating bodhisattva practices, do not slight or slander others."

爾時，世尊而說偈言：

「不以諛諂親善友、　　於人勝法無妬心、
　他獲名譽常歡喜、　　不謗菩薩得無怨。
At that time, the World Honored One spoke the following verse:
<i>Do not flatter good Dharma friends,
Do not become jealous of others' accomplishments,
Delight in the renown gained by others,
Do not slander bodhisattvas.
Then one will be blameless.</i>

[0082b16] 「復次，妙慧！菩薩成就四法，所言人信。何等為四？一者、發言修行常使相應，二者、於善友所不覆諸惡，三者、於所聞法不求過失，四者、於說法者不生惡心。」
"Once again, Sumati, bodhisattvas use four methods to ensure that people trust their every word. What four? First, always be consistent in your words and practice. Second, do not hide your wrongdoings from good Dharma friends. Third, do not seek fault in the Dharma one hears. Fourth, do not give rise to unwholesome thoughts towards those who speak the Dharma."

[0082b19] 爾時，世尊而說偈言：

「發言修行常相應、　　己罪不藏於善友、
　聞經不求人法過，　　所言一切皆信受。
At that time, the World Honored One spoke a verse:
<i>Be consistent in your words and practice.
Do not hide your wrongdoing from good Dharma friends.
Do not seek fault in the Dharma one hears.
Then all your words will be believed and trusted.</i>

[0082b22] 「復次，妙慧！菩薩成就四法能離法障，速得清淨。何等為四？一者、以深意樂攝三律儀，二者、聞甚深經不生誹謗，三者、見新發意菩薩生一切智心，四者、於諸有情大慈平等。」
"Once again, Sumati, bodhisattvas have four methods to eliminate Dharma obstructions and be pure. What four? First, embrace the three categories of bodhisattva precepts. Second, after hearing the profound sutras, do not slander them. Third, see those who make their initial intention, then give rise to the mind of all wisdom. Fourth, treat all sentient beings with great loving-kindness and equanamity."

[0082b25] 爾時，世尊而說偈言：

「以深意樂攝律儀、　　聞甚深經能信解、
　敬初發心如佛想、　　慈心普洽障消除。
At that time, the World Honored One spoke a verse:
<i>Deeply embrace the discipline,
Listen to the profound sutras and have faith,
Venerate the initial intention as one would the Buddha,
And have a heart of universal loving-kindness. Then obstructions will be eliminated.</i>

[0082b29] 「復次，妙慧！菩薩成就四法能離諸魔。云何為四？一者、了知法性平等，二者、發起精進，三者、常勤念佛，四者、一切善根皆悉迴向。」
"Once again, Sumati, bodhisattvas have four methods for avoiding Mara. What four? First, completely understand that Dharma nature is equal. Second, give rise to diligence. Third, constantly contemplate the Buddha. Fourth, dedicate the merit from all wholesome roots."

[0082c02] 爾時，世尊而說偈言：

「能知諸法平等性、　　常起精進、念如來、
　迴向一切諸善根，　　眾魔不能得其便。
At that time, the World Honored One spoke a verse:
<i>If one is able to know that Dharma nature is equal,
Constantly contemplate the Tathagata,
and dedicate the merit from all wholesome roots,
then the myriad Mara cannot hinder you.</i>

[0082c06] 「復次，妙慧！菩薩成就四法臨命終時諸佛現前。何等為四？一者、他有所求施令滿足，二者、於諸善法深生信解，三者、於諸菩薩施莊嚴具，四者、於三寶所勤修供養。」
"Once again, Sumati, bodhisattvas use four methods to ensure that they will be greeted by Buddhas at the end of life. What four? First, give gifts to satisfy the needs of others. Second, produce a deep faith in all wholesome teachings. Third, offer all bodhisattvas their ornaments. Fourth, diligently make offerings to the Triple Gem."

[0082c09] 爾時，世尊而說偈言：

「他有所求令滿足、　　信解深法、捨嚴具、
　三寶福田勤供養，　　臨命終時佛現前。」
At that time, the World Honored One spoke a verse:
<i>Fulfill the needs of others,
Believe the profound Dharma and provide requisites,
Diligently make offerings to the Triple Gem as a field of merit,
And at the end of life the Buddha will appear.</i>

[0082c13] 爾時，妙慧童女聞佛說已，白言：「世尊！如佛所說菩薩諸行，我當奉行。世尊！若我於是四十行中闕於一行而不修者，則違佛教、欺誑如來。」
At that time, the young girl Sumati, having heard the Buddha's words, said to him. "World Honored One, of all the bodhisattva practices the Buddha has spoken of, I vow to uphold and practice them. World Honored One, if I do not practice even one of these forty methods, then I will have turned my back on the Buddha's teachings and lied to the Tathagata."

[0082c17] 爾時，尊者大目揵連告妙慧言：「菩薩之行甚難可行。汝今發斯殊勝大願，豈於是願得自在耶？」
At that time, Venerable Maudgalyayana said to Sumati, "The bodhisattva path is very difficult to practice. Just now, you have made an extraordinarily great vow. Can you fulfill it with ease?"

[0082c20] 爾時，妙慧白言：「尊者！若我弘願真實不虛、能令諸行得圓滿者，願此三千大千世界六種震動。」
At that time, Sumati said, "Venerable, if my vows are true, not false, and I am able to perfectly cultivate all these methods, then may this three thousand-fold world system quake in six ways, may wonderous flowers rain down from the heavens, and may heavenly drums beat of their own accord."
Once these words were spoken, out of empty space, flowers fell like rain, heavenly drums beat on their own, and the three thousand-fold world system quaked in six ways.

[0082c23] 是時，妙慧重白目連：「以我如是真實言故，於未來世當得成佛——亦如今日釋迦如來——於我國中無有魔事及以惡趣、女人之名。若我此言非虛妄者，令斯大眾身皆金色。」說是語已，眾皆金色。
The Sumati said again to Maudgalyayana, "In accordance with the truth I have spoken, in a future life, I will become a Buddha, just as Sakyamuni Tathagata is now. In my Buddha land, there [will be] no Mara, no rebirth in lower realms, and no one called 'woman.' If what I say is not false, may the bodies of all in this great assembly become gold in color!"
As these words were spoken, everyone became golden colored.

[0082c28] 爾時，尊者大目揵連即從坐起，偏袒右肩，頂禮佛足，白言：「世尊！我今先禮初發心菩薩及諸菩薩摩訶薩眾。」
At that time, Venerable Maudgalyayana rose from his seat, bore his right shoulder, paid homage to the Buddha, and said, "World Honored One, I first prostrate myself before those bodhisattvas who have made their initial intention, and I will bow before all great bodhisattvas as well."

[0083a02] 爾時，文殊師利法王子告妙慧言：「汝住何法發斯誠願？」
At that time, Dharma Prince Manjusri, said to Sumati, "Upon what Dharma do you abide in to make such a sincere vow?"

[0083a03] 妙慧答言：「文殊師利！非所問也。何以故？於法界中無所住故。」
Sumati said, "Manjusri, you should not ask that question. Why? There is no Dharma to abide in."

[0083a04] 又問：「云何名為菩提？」
He further asked, "What is 'bodhi?'"

[0083a05] 答曰：「無分別法，是名菩提。」
She said, "The Dharma of non-discrimination is 'bodhi.'"

[0083a05] 又問：「云何名為菩薩？」
He further asked, "What are 'bodhisattvas?'"

[0083a06] 答曰：「一切諸法等虛空相，是名菩薩。」
She said, "[Those who] see all phenomena as empty are 'bodhisattvas.'"

[0083a06] 又問：「云何名為菩提之行？」
He further asked, "What are bodhisattva practices?"

[0083a07] 答曰：「猶如陽焰、谷響之行，是菩提行。」
She said, "Practices which are like a mirage or an echo from a valley. These are bodhisattva practices."

[0083a09] 又問：「依何密意作如是說？」
He further asked, "Is there any hidden meaning to what you have said?"

[0083a09] 答曰：「我於此中不見少法密、非密者。」
She said, "In what I have said, I do not see the wonderous Dharma as either hidden or overt."

[0083a10] 又問：「若如是者，一切凡夫應即菩提。」
He further asked, "If it is as you say, then all ordinary beings are enlightened!"

[0083a11] 答曰：「汝謂菩提異凡夫耶？莫作是見。何以故？此等皆同一法界相，非取、非捨，無成、壞故。」
She said, "Do you claim that enlightened beings and ordinary beings are different? Do not hold such a view. Why? Both share the same form in the Dharma realm. There can be no clinging or rejecting, as there is no formation or destruction."

[0083a13] 又問：「於此義中能解了者，其數幾何？」
He further asked, "How many are there who can understand this doctrine?"

[0083a14] 答曰：「如若干幻化心心所量，若干幻化眾生能了斯義。」
She said, "However many illusory thoughts can be counted, that is how many sentient beings can understand this doctrine."

[0083a15] 文殊師利言：「幻化本無，何有如是心心所法？」
Manjusri said, "If illusory forms are inherently non-existent, how can the mind and mental phenomena exist?"

[0083a16] 答曰：「法界亦爾，非有、非無；乃至如來亦復如是。」
She said, "They are like the Dharma realm. It is neither existent nor non-existent. The Tathagata is also this way."

[0083a17] 爾時，文殊師利白佛言：「世尊！今此妙慧甚為希有，乃能成就如是法忍。」
At that time, Manjusri said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, it is rare to encounter one like this girl, Sumati. She will be able to attain the patience of phenomena."

[0083a18] 佛言：「如是，如是，誠如所言。然此童女已於過去發菩提心，經三十劫我乃發趣無上菩提，彼亦令汝住無生忍。」
The Buddha said, "It is so, it is so! Your words are true. This young girl already gave rise to the bodhi mind over thirty <i>kalpas</i> before I made my own supreme bodhi vow. She also guided you to abide in the patience of the non-arising of phenomena."

[0083a22] 爾時，文殊師利即從坐起，為其作禮，白妙慧言：「我於往昔無量劫前已曾供養，不謂今者還得親近。」
At that time, Manjusri rose from his seat, paid homage to her, and said to Sumati, "Innumerable <i>kalpas</i> ago, I mad offerings to you. How fortunate it is that I can learn from you again."

[0083a24] 妙慧告言：「文殊師利！汝今莫起如是分別。何以故？以無分別得無生忍故。」
Sumati answered, "Manjusri, You should not make such discriminations. Why not? This is because, through non-discrimination, the patience of the non-arising phenomena is gained."

[0083a25] 又問：「妙慧！汝今猶不轉女身耶？」
He further asked, "Sumati, why have you not turned away from your female body?"

[0083a26] 妙慧答言：「女人之相了不可得，今何所轉？
Sumati said, "The female form cannot be attained. What is there to turn away from?"

[0083a28] 「文殊師利！我當為汝除斷疑惑。由我如是真實語故，於當來世得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提時，於我法中諸比丘輩聞命善來出家入道，
"Manjusri, I will now eliminate your doubts. Due to my sincere words, in the future, I will attain supreme, perfect enlightenment. After listening to my Dharma, all bhiksus will hear, 'well come,' and enter the path."

我國土中所有眾生身皆金色，服用資具如第六天、飲食豐饒隨念而至，無有魔事及諸惡趣，亦復無有女人之名，有七寶林上羅寶網、七寶蓮花覆以寶帳——如文殊師利所成淨剎，裝挍嚴飾等無有異。
"In my land, all sentient beings are golden. All their necessities are provided, just like in the sixth heaven of the desire realm. Food and drink are abundant and appear at a thought. There [will be] no Mara, no rebirth in lower realms, and no one called 'woman.' There are seven treasure forests, netting of fine cloth and valuable jade, and seven treasure lotus flowers, all covered with jeweled canopies. It is similar to Manjusri's Pure Land: covered in rich adornments, without any difference."

[0083b07] 「若我此言非虛妄者，令此大眾身皆金色，我之女身變成男子，如三十歲知法比丘。」
"If what I have said is true and not false, may everyone in attendance take on a golden hue, and may my female body change and become male, appearing to be a thirty-year-old bhiksu well-versed in the Dharma."

[0083b08] 說此語時，此諸大眾皆作金色，妙慧菩薩轉女成男，如三十歲知法比丘。
After saying this, everyone in attendance turned golden. Sumati Bodhisattva changed from female to male, and appeared as a thirty-year-old bhiksu well-versed in the Dharma.

[0083b10] 是時，地居天眾展轉讚言：「大哉，大哉。妙慧菩薩摩訶薩能於來世得菩提時嚴持佛剎功德如是。」
At that time, the heavenly beings who dwelled in Mount Sumeru descended to offer praise one at a time, "Excellent! Excellent! When the Great Sumati Bodhisattva attains bodhi, there will be a glorious pristine Buddha land. Such is her virtue."

[0083b13] 爾時，佛告文殊師利：「此妙慧菩薩於當來世成等正覺，號殊勝功德寶藏如來，出現於世。」
At that time, the Buddha said to Manjusri, "In the future, this Sumati Bodhisattva will attain perfect enlightenment and be called Shusheng Gongde Baozang Tathagata [Excellent Virtuous Treasure Tathagata]."

佛說此經時，三十俱胝眾生於阿耨多羅三藐三菩提住不退轉，八十俱胝眾生遠塵離垢得法眼淨，八千眾生皆獲智證。
As the Buddha spoke this sutra, thirty <i>kotis</i> of sentient beings came to reside upon supreme, perfect enlightenment, abiding in non-transgression. Eighty <i>kotis</i> of sentient beings left defilement far behind and obtained pure Dharma eyes. Eighty thousand sentient beings gained liberating wisdom.

[0083b17] 五千比丘行菩薩乘心欲退轉，因見妙慧菩薩意樂善根、威德殊勝故，各各脫身所著上服以施如來。
There were five thousand bhiksus who were about to turn away from the bodhisattva path. But because they witnessed Sumati Bodhisattva's aspiration and wholesome roots, and saw her majestic virtue and excellent character, they removed their upper garments and offered them to the Tathagata. 

[0083b21] 如是施已，發弘誓言：「我等以此善根決定願成阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。」
Having presented their offering, they made a great vow, "With these wholesome roots, we absolutely will achieve supreme perfect enlightenment."

彼諸善男子等以此善根迴向無上菩提故，超九十劫生死之苦，不退轉於阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。
These good men took their wholesome roots and dedicated the merit to supreme bodhi. They transcended ninety <i>kalpas</i> of the suffering of birth and death and came to abide in supreme perfect enlightenment, from which they would never regress.

[0083b25] 爾時，世尊即記之曰：「汝等於當來世過千劫後，於無垢光明劫中，陽焰世界難忍佛剎，於一劫中相次成佛，皆同一字，號辯才莊嚴如來，出現於世。
At that time, the World Honored One made a prophecy, "All of you will reside in a future known as the '<i>kalpa</i> of undefiled light.' It will occur one thousand <i>kalpas</i> from now, in the Rare Endurable Buddha Land of the Mirage World. There, many will attain Buddhahood together, and share the name Biancai Zhuangyan Tathagata [Eloquent and Dignified Tathagata].

[0083b28] 「文殊師利！如是法門有大威德，能令菩薩摩訶薩及聲聞乘者獲大利益。
"Manjusri, this teaching posesses great majesty and virtue. It is able to bring great benefit to great bodhisattvas, and <i>sravaka</i> followers.

文殊師利！或有善男子、善女人為求菩提，無方便善巧行六波羅蜜足滿千劫，若復有人經於半月時一書寫、讀誦此經，所獲福聚比前功德百分、千分、百千俱胝乃至算數譬喻所不能及。
"Manjusri, there may be good men and women who pursue bodhi. But due to their lack of skillful means, they practice the six perfections for thousands of <i>kalpas</i>. Even if a person copied this sutra for a short half a month, the merit gained by this person would surpass the merit of the previous practitioner: saying it is one hundred <i>kotis</i> greater, one thousand <i>kotis</i> greater, or even one hundred thousand <i>kotis</i> greater is not enough to adequately convey the difference.

[0083c06] 「是故，文殊師利！如是微妙法門即諸菩薩契經之本，我今付囑於汝，汝當來世受持、讀誦、為人解說。譬如轉輪聖王出現於世，所有七寶皆悉在前；王滅之後，寶皆隱沒。如是微妙法門流行於世，即諸如來七菩提分等法明不滅；若不流行，正法常滅。
"Therefore, Manjusri, this teaching should be recorded as a sutra for all bodhisattvas. Now I am entrusting it to you. In future lives, receive, uphold, read, recite, and expound this sutra to others. It is as if a wheel-turning monarch was to appear in this world with his seven treasures. After he died, those treasures would disappear. But if this wonderous teaching became widespread throughout the world, the seven factors or awakening and others teachings will remain. However, should it not become widespread, the right Dharma will disappear.

[0083c12] 「是故，文殊師利！若善男子、善女人等為求菩提，應當發起精進，書寫此經、受持讀誦、為人演說。此是我教，勿於後世生悔恨心。」
"Therefore, Manjusri, good men and women who pursue bodhi should give rise to diligence, transcribe the sutra, receive it, uphold it, recite it, and expound it to others. This is my teaching. Upholding them so that no regrets will form in future ages."

[0083c14] 佛說此經已，妙慧菩薩、文殊師利菩薩，及諸大眾、天、人、阿修羅、乾闥婆等，聞佛所說，皆大歡喜，信受奉行。
After the Buddha delivered this sutra, Sumati Bodhisattva, Manjusri Bodhisattva, and all the heavenly beings, humans, asuras, gandharvas, and other beings in attendance were all overjoyed at having heard the Buddha's teachings. They faithfully received this teaching and practice.
