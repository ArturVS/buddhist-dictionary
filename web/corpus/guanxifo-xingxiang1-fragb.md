### Summary
After the passing of the Buddha, Virtuous men and women will obtain immeasuable merit by sincerely reciting the name of the Buddha, bathing the Buddha, as when he was in this world. The Buddha said, when he was practicing the bodhisattva path was reborn 36 times as a Heavenly King, 36 times as a Chakravarti King, and 36 times as a flying emperor. If someone bathes a Buddha statue with fragrant mixed flowers then they will obtain what they wish for and they will be proteced by dragons and spirits. If the person wishes to leave the evil realms in all their future rebirths then they can obtain that. If they wish to be reborn in the heavenly realms or as a rich person in the earthly realm then they can obtain that. If they wish to have one hundred sons and one thousand grandsons they they can obtain that. If they wish to have longevity without sickness then they can obtain that.
