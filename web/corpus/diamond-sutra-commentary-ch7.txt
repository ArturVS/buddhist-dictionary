<div class="text">「須菩提！ 於意云何？如來得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提耶？如來有所說法耶？」　須菩提言： 「如我解佛所說義， 無有定法名阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，亦無有定法，如來可說。 何以故？如來所說法，皆不可取、不可說、非法、非非法。 所以者何？一切賢聖， 皆以無為法而有差別。」

Yifa: “Subhuti, what does your mind say? Has the Tathagata attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi? Has the Tathagata spoken of any Dharma?”

Subhuti replied, “As I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said, there is no definite dharma called anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, and there is no definite Dharma the Tathagata can speak of. Why is this? Because the Tathagata says that all dharmas cannot be held, cannot be spoken of; are neither the Dharma nor not the Dharma. How is this?”

“All saints and sages are distinguished by the unconditioned dharmas.”

Subhūti answers the Buddha's question explaining that there is no fixed idea of Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi. Since it is a dharma it is subject to impermanence and non-self.

Unconditioned dharmas (Sanskrit: asaṃskṛtaprabhāvitā, Chinese 無為法) means things that do not arise from causes and conditions.

Teaching the Dhárma is described in more depth in Section 21.

The English term in the text noble ones translates the Sanskrit āryapudgala (Chinese: 賢聖). This is a compound word created from ārya (noble) and pudgala (person). This group includes Srotāpannas (Sanskrit, Chinese: 須陀洹), also known as Stream-Enterers, Sakridāgāmi (Sanskrit, Chinese: 斯陀含), also known as Once-Returners, Anāgāmi (Sanskrit, Chinese: 斯陀含), also known as Non-Returners, and Arhats (Sanskrit, Chinese: 阿羅漢), fully awakened people [Thich Nhat Hanh, 2010, p 73]. The Sanskrit word prabhāvitā (Chinese: 有) in this passage means to have or to possess.

Ananda explains the teaching of the Dharma in a similar way in the Ajivaka Sutta,

<div class="commentary">'Those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion — their Dhamma is well-taught. Those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion, for the abandoning of aversion, for the abandoning of delusion — they have practiced well in this world. Those whose passion... aversion... 

"How amazing, sir. How astounding, that there is neither extolling of one's own Dhamma nor deprecation of another's ...
