<h3>The merits of prajñā are incomparable 福智無比分</h3>

<div class="text">「須菩提！ 若三千大千世界中所有諸須彌山王，如是等七寶聚，有人持用布施； 若人以此般若波羅蜜經，乃至四句偈等，受持讀誦、 為他人說，於前福德百分不及一， 百千萬億分，乃至算數譬喻所不能及。

“Subhūti, suppose three thousand great thousand-worlds all contained Sumeru, King of Mountains [parvatarājā], and there were mountains [rāśī] such as this of the Seven Precious Jewels, given away by someone in the practice of giving [dāna]. If a person has only a four-line gāthā from this Prajñāpāramitā sūtra, and accepts, maintains, studies, recites, and speaks it for others, then the merits [puṇya] of the other person are not even one hundredth as good. They are so vastly inferior that the two are incomparable.

The Buddha is making a reference to the cosmic being Puruṣa, as in Section 10, Section 13, Section 15, and Section 17. It is the sixth comparison that compares material wealth with the teachings, this time it compares giving of wealth with giving by propogating the teachings. Also important is the analogy with Mount Sumeru, the largest mountain in the Universe and situated in the center (alternatively, one is situated in the center of every world in the Universe). The self is the largest object and in the center of the mind, thus the analogy imploring the listener to let go of attachment to the self. The analogy represents the self as the pile of jewels at the center of the Universe that should be let go of. Hui Neng says,

<div class="commentary">The height and diameter of Mount Sumeru is 3,360,000 miles. ... But in terms of meaning, the deluded thoughts of desire, anger, and ignorance each comprise an entire thousand-world system. 
(Red Pine 2009, p 362 translating Hui Neng Exegesis on the Diamond Sutra 金剛經解義, Manji 0459)

The English name King of Mountains translates the Chinese 山王, Sanskrit parvatarājā. The Sanskrit word parvata means mountain (Chinese 山). The second use of the word mountain in English translates the Sanskrit rāśī (English: heap), which is not present in the Chinese.
