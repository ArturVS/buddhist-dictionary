<h3>The adornment of pure lands 莊嚴淨土分<h3>

<div class="text">佛告須菩提： 「於意云何？如來昔在然燈佛所，於法有所得不？」　「世尊！ 如來在然燈佛所，於法實無所得。」

The Buddha addressed Subhūti, saying, “What do you think? In the past when the Tathāgata was with Dīpaṃkara Buddha, was there any dharma obtained?” “No, Bhagavān. When the Tathāgata was with Dīpaṃkara Buddha there was truly no dharma obtained [gṛhīta].”

Sanskrit: bhagavānāha-tatkiṃ manyase subhūte-asti sa kaściddharmo yastathāgatena dīpaṃkarasya tathāgatasyārhata-samyaksaṃbuddhasyāntikādudgṛhītaḥ ? subhūtirāha- no hīdaṃ bhagavan| nāsti sa kaściddharmo yastathāgatena dīpaṃkarasya tathāgatasyārhataḥ samyaksaṃbuddhasyāntikādudgṛhītaḥ||

Dīpaṃkara (Chinese: 然燈佛), literally lamp (Sanskrit: dipa, Chinese: 燈) bearer, was the previous Buddha. He bestowed a prediction on Śākyamuni that he would become a Buddha in the future. At that time Śākyamuni Buddha was a bodhisattva called Sumedha. The Cārya-nidāna includes a story of Dīpaṃkara meeting the Buddha in a past life as the Brahmin boy Sumedha. The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines says,

<div class="commentary">So it is, O Gods! So did I, when I met the Tathagata Dipankara in the bazaar of Dipavati, the royal city, possess the fullness of this perfection of wisdom, so that Dipankara, the Tathagata, predicted that one day I should be fully enlightened, and said to me: "You, young Brahmin, shall in a future period, after incalculable aeons, become a Tathagata, Sakyamuni by name ..."
(Conze, 1973, p102)

The Sanskrit text uses the term samyaksaṃbuddhasyāntikādudgṛhīta, which literally means "supreme enlightenment obtained," and this is the meaning of dharma (Chinese: 法) in this context.

<div class="text">「須菩提！ 於意云何？菩薩莊嚴佛土不？」　「不也，世尊！ 何以故？莊嚴佛土者，則非莊嚴，是名莊嚴。」「是故須菩提， 諸菩薩摩訶薩應如是生清淨心， 不應住色生心，不應住聲、香、味、觸、法生心，應無所住而生其心。

“Subhūti, what do you think? Do bodhisattvas adorn [niṣpādayiṣyāmīti] buddha-lands [kṣetravyūhā]?” “No, Bhagavān. Why? The adornments of buddha-lands are not adornments, and are thus called adornments.” “Therefore [tarhi], Subhūti, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should thusly give rise to a clear and pure [utpādayitavya] mind [citta] — a mind [citta] not associated with abiding [pratiṣṭhita] in form [rūpa]; a mind [citta] not associated with abiding in sounds [śabda], scents [ganda], tastes [rasa], sensations [spraṣṭavya], or dharmas; a mind [citta] not abiding in life.

Sanskrit: bhagavānāha-yaḥ kaścitsubhūte bodhisattva evaṃ vadet-ahaṃ kṣetravyūhān niṣpādayiṣyāmīti, sa vitathaṃ vadet| tatkasya hetoḥ ? kṣetravyūhāḥ kṣetravyūhā iti subhūte avyūhāste tathāgatena bhāṣitāḥ| tenocyante kṣetravyūhā iti| tasmāttarhi subhūte bodhisattvena mahāsattvena evamapratiṣṭhitaṃ cittamutpādayitavyaṃ yanna kvacitpratiṣṭhitaṃ cittamutpādayitavyam| na rūpapratiṣṭhitaṃ cittamutpādayitavyaṃ na śabdagandharasaspraṣṭavyadharmapratiṣṭhitaṃ cittamutpādayitavyam|

Each of the four instances of the English word mind in this passage translates the Chinese 心, Sanskrit citta. 

The English word adorn translates the Chinese 莊嚴. The word in the Sanskrit is niṣpādayiṣyāmīti, derived from the word niṣpādayati, which Conze translates as create but also notes can mean "accomplish, perfect, achieve, ripen, and mature". (Conze 1958, p44) The word buddha-land translates the Chinese 佛土. Conze translates the phrase " adorn buddha-lands" above as "create harmonious Buddhafields." A similar use of this word occurs many times in the Amitābha Sūtra where the Western Pure Land is ... "adorned with gold, silver, lapis lazuli, crystal, mother-of-pearl, red pearls, and carnelian." (T 12 No. 0366) The point in this passage is to avoid attachment to those adornments.

The Sanskrit used for Buddha-lands worlds is kṣetravyūhā.

The English phrase "give rise to a clear and pure mind" translates the Chinese 生清淨心 and Sanskrit compound cittamutpādayitavyam, which is composed of the parts citta (mind) + utpādayitavya (to tame).

Subhūti, suppose a person had a body like Mount Sumeru, King of Mountains [parvatarāja]. Would this body be great?” Subhūti replied, “It would be extremely great, Bhagavān. Why? The Buddha teaches that no body is the Great Body.”

Sanskrit: tadyathāpi nāma subhūte puruṣo bhavedupetakāyo mahākāyo yattasyaivaṃ rūpa ātmabhāvaḥ syāt tadyathāpi nāma sumeruḥ parvatarājaḥ| tatkiṃ manyase subhūte api nu mahān sa ātmabhāvo bhavet ? subhūtirāha-mahān sa bhagavān, mahān sugata sa ātmabhāvo bhavet| tatkasya hetoḥ ? ātmabhāva ātmabhāva iti bhagavan na bhāvaḥ sa tathāgatena bhāṣitaḥ| tenocyata ātmabhāva iti| na hi bhagavan sa bhāvo nābhāvaḥ| tenocyate ātmabhāva iti||10||

This is a reference to the Vedic god Puruṣa, who sacrificed his body to create the universe. In fact, the Sanskrit text mentions Puruṣa (modified form: puruṣo) directly. Puruṣa had a thousand heads, eyes, and feet and was divided up to form the Universe. (Mittal and Thursby 2006, p 34)

The Sanskrit text uses the compound <em>ātmabhāva</em> five times in this passage, although it is glossed over in the Chinese and English translations. Conze (1958, p 46) translates this as "personal existence."

The physical body and abiding in form are also mentioned in chapters 14, 17, and 20.
