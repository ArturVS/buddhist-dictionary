Pervading the Dharma Realm 法界通分分

Text 原文本

「須菩提！ 於意云何？若有人滿三千大千世界七寶以用布施，是人以是因緣， 得福多不？」　「如是，世尊！此人以是因緣，得福甚多。」 「須菩提！若福德有實，如來不說得福德多； 以福德無故，如來說得福德多。

“Subhūti, what do you think? If someone filled three thousand great thousand-worlds with the Seven Precious Jewels [saptaratnaparipūrṇa], and gave them away in the practice of giving [dāna], would this person obtain many merits [puṇya] from such causes and conditions [nidāna]?” “Thusly, Bhagavān, from such causes and conditions [nidāna], the merits [puṇya] of this person would be extremely many.” “Subhūti, if such merits [puṇya] truly existed, then the Tathāgata would not say that many merits [puṇya] that are obtained. It is from the merits [puṇya] that are unconditioned [askandha], that the Tathāgata speaks of obtaining many merits [puṇya].

Comments

Here the Buddha explains that the merits generated from unconditional giving are also unconditioned (Chinese 無故, Sanskrit askandha). Therefore, he describes them as immeasurable. The Seven Precious Jewels were mentioned in Section 8, where the Buddha said that the merit from accepts and maintains even as little as a four-line gāthā from within this sūtra is greater than giving the Seven Precious Jewels. Here the point made is that the merit is great but inherently empty. True merit is gained from giving without attachment.

The English phrase causes and conditions translates the Chinese 因緣, Sanskrit nidāna.
