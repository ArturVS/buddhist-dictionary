### Summary
The Buddha said, when I was a bodhisattva in the world, I was reborn as a Heavenly King 36 times, a cakra-ratna king 36 times, as a flying emperor 36 times. Any person who sincerely bathes a Buddha statue will obtain merit know to all the devas and spirits.

The Buddha said, it is difficult for a person to encounter the Buddha's sūtras or hear the teachings.
