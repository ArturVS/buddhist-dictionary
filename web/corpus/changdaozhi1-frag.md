### Summary

On the eighth day of the Fourth Month in the year 503 of the Northern Wei the Buddhist disciple Chang Dao Zhi prayed to the Triple Gem and made a vow. He vowed that he would 20 mu of temple land to construct a five storied building for the permanent housing of the monastics so that it would always bring blessings to the temple. He hoped that this would allow the monastics to never forget their ancestors and parents. This inscription is provided to commemorate that.
