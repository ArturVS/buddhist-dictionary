### Summary
This scroll includes a passage:

北魏孝文。詔德法師一月三入殿說法。帝數幸王園寺。與沙門談論佛法○幸白塔寺聽登法師講成實論○詔四月八日迎洛京諸寺佛像。入閶闔宮受散花禮敬○宣武御式乾殿講維摩經。西域沙門至者三千人。

This passage says that on the third day of the first month Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei Dynasty ordered venerables to come to the palace hall to teach the Dhárma. The emperor went to Wang Yuan Temple to discuss the Dhárma with the venerables and also to Bai Ta Temple to list to a talk on the Satyasiddhi-sastra. On the eighth day of the fourth month he observed Buddha statues in Luoyang. He scattered flowers and bowed to them as they entered the palace gate. The Vimalakirti Sutra was recited in the palace hall. There were three thousand monks from the Western Regions.
