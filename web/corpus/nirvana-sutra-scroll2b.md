### English translation

A Buddha is born on the 8th day of the 4th month; gives up his home on the 8th day of the 4th month; attains the way of the Buddha on the 8th day of the 4th month; and achieves nirvāṇa on the 8th day of the 4th month. Each takes place at the rising of the stars of puṣya. At this time, all the flowers are in blossom, and the trees lush with growth.
