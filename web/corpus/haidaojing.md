This passage describes the journey from the Port of Liujia 劉家港 (present-day Liuhe, Taicang), at the mouth of the Yangtze River to Tianjin:

In the former Yuan, in the twentieth year of the Zhiyuan reign [1284] one could travel to Jiangnan to fetch goods. Starting in the twenty first year of the Zhiyuan reign [1285] grain was shipped by sea. Zhu Qing and Zhang Xuan were used to lead ten thousand units. Ships for transporting 35,000 dan of grain. Departments were established with ten thousand, one thousand, one hundred official units for administration of grain ships. Officials recieved Hufu [a title], Gold Paimian [an official document], and plain Silver Paimian, in addition to different grades of office to manage ship building. Large [ships] would carry one year of rations and smaller [ships] would carry three hundred dan. [Sailing] from the Port of Liujia one leaves the mouth of the Yangtze River. Then one goes around the mouth of the river, checking for [unauthorized] shipping of Chinese goldthread. Looking northwest along [the coast], travel in a perpendicular direction. Travel with the tide as it rises. Throw out an anchor as the tide falls. In approximately half a month to a little more than a month, one arrives at the mouth of the Huai River. Passing Jiaozhou, Haimen, Fushan, Laoshan, Fu Island, along mountainous terrain all the way. Head east continuing as far as Zhen Island and then head north. Turn past Chengshan and head west. Passing Jiugao Island, Liugong Island, Zhugaoshan, Liujiawa, and Shamen Island [Changdao County] in Dengzhou, launch across the open ocean to Laizhou. It takes more than two months until one enters the river estuary and arrives at Zhigu [Tianjin]. This water route is truly difficult and the scouting arduous.
