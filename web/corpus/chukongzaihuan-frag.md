### Summary
This fragment describes the following:

When the Buddha came into the city the spirits and demons in the air retreated. Those on land competed to escape from the city gates, which could not contain them and collapsed under their charge. At that time the city was unclean with restroom dirt and the foul smells of evil. All of that disappeared into the ground, into a pit that was levelled flat. Afterwards, the blind could see, the deaf could hear, the mute could speak, and the lame could walk. The uncivilized became upright and the sick recovered. Elephants, horses, cows, and farm animals lost their sadness and had peace. Musical instruments played by themselves. Palace trade was harmonious. Women wore pearl bracelets. High pavilions made wonderful sounds. Earthenware pots had sounds of their own, soft and joyful sounds of the Dharma. Sentient beings that were concealed in the ground came out. As if hot and thirsty people had found cool water to revive themselves and found clothes to wear. The city was liberated from its ailments. When the Buddha and his followers left the city the people were sad. They hoped that he would walk around the city to spread the Dharma, give auspicious signs, and prevent disasters and epidemics.
