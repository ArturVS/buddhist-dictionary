<h3>Not receiving, not desiring 不受不貪分</h3>
<h4>Text</h4>

<div class="text">「須菩提！ 若菩薩以滿恆河沙等世界七寶布施； 若復有人知一切法無我，得成於忍， 此菩薩勝前菩薩所得功德。須菩提！以諸菩薩不受福德故。」 須菩提白佛言：「世尊！云何菩薩不受福德？」 「須菩提！菩薩所作福德，不應貪著， 是故說不受福德。

“Subhūti, suppose a bodhisattva, in the practice of giving [dāna], filled as many world realms [lokadhātu] with the Seven Precious Jewels [saptaratnaparipūrṇa], as there are grains of sand [vālukā] in the Ganges River [gaṅgā]. If there is a person with the awareness that all dharmas are without self, and accomplishes their complete endurance [kṣānti], then this is superior, and the merits [puṇya] attained by this bodhisattva surpass those of the previous bodhisattva. Subhūti, the reason for this is that bodhisattvas do not receive merit [puṇya].” Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying, “Bhagavān, why do you say that bodhisattvas do not receive] merit [puṇya]?” “Subhūti, for bodhisattvas to make merit [puṇya], they should not greedily wish to acquire [parigraha] it, and therefore it is said that there is no merit [puṇya] received.

<h4>Comments</h4>

The English word endurance translates the Chinese 忍, Sanskrit kṣānti. This could be better translated as tolerance or forbearance. It is the third of the six paramitas. The English word acquire translates the Chinese 得, Sanskrit parigraha.

In the Issattha Sutta King Pasenadi of Kosala asked the Blessed One

<div class="commentary">Blessed One: "Where, lord, should a gift be given?"

"Wherever the mind feels confidence, great king."

"But a gift given where, lord, bears great fruit?"

"This [question] is one thing, great king — 'Where should a gift be given?' — while this — 'A gift given where bears great fruit?' — is something else entirely. What is given to a virtuous person — rather than to an unvirtuous one — bears great fruit.
(SN 3.24<sup>1</sup>)

This chapter resolves the reason for the Buddha saying previously that no merit was obtained: he says that so that bodhisattvas would not attach to it.
