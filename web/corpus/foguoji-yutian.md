### Passage
法顯等欲觀行像，停三月日。

其國中十四大僧伽藍，不數小者。從四月一日，城裏便掃灑道路，莊嚴巷陌。其城門上張大幃幕，事事嚴餝，王及夫人、采女皆住其中。瞿摩帝僧是大乘學，王所敬重，最先行像。離城三四里，作四輪像車，高三丈餘，狀如行殿，七寶莊校，懸繒幡蓋。像立車中，二菩薩侍，作諸天侍從，皆以金銀彫瑩，懸於虛空。像去門百步，王脫天冠，易著新衣，徒跣持華香，翼從出城迎像，頭面禮足，散華燒香。像入城時，門樓上夫人、采女遙散衆華，紛紛而下。如是莊嚴供具，車車各異。一僧伽藍則一日行像。白月一日爲始，至十四日行像乃訖。行像訖，王及夫人乃還宮耳。

### English translation

Hwuy-king, Tao-ching, and Hwuy-tah set out in advance towards the country of K’eeh-ch’a; but Fa-hien and the others, wishing to see the procession of images, remained behind for three months. There are in this country four great monasteries, not counting the smaller ones. Beginning on the first day of the fourth month, they sweep and water the streets inside the city, making a grand display in the lanes and byways. Over the city gate they pitch a large tent, grandly adorned in all possible ways, in which the king and queen, with their ladies brilliantly arrayed, take up their residence (for the time). The monks of the Gomati monastery, being mahayana students, and held in greatest reverence by the king, took precedence of all the others in the procession. At a distance of three or four le from the city, they made a four-wheeled image car, more than thirty cubits high, which looked like the great hall (of a monastery) moving along. The seven precious substances were grandly displayed about it, with silken streamers and canopies hanging all around. The chief image stood in the middle of the car, with two bodhisattvas in attendance on it, while devas were made to follow in waiting, all brilliantly carved in gold and silver, and hanging in the air. When the car was a hundred paces from the gate, the king put off his crown of state, changed his dress for a fresh suit, and with bare feet, carrying in his hands flowers and incense, and with two rows of attending followers, went out at the gate to meet the image; and, with his face (bowed to the ground), he did homage at its feet, and then scattered the flowers and burnt the incense. When the image was entering the gate, the queen and the brilliant ladies with her in the gallery above scattered far and wide all kinds of flowers, which floated about and fell promiscuously to the ground. In this way everything was done to promote the dignity of the occasion. The carriages of the monasteries were all different, and each one had its own day for the procession. (The ceremony) began on the first day of the fourth month, and ended on the fourteenth, after which the king and queen returned to the palace.
