<h3>The principle of the unity of appearances 一合理相分</h3>

<div class="text">「須菩提！若善男子、善女人， 以三千大千世界碎為微塵，於意云何？是微塵眾寧為多不？」 「甚多，世尊！何以故？若是微塵眾實有者， 佛則不說是微塵眾。所以者何？佛說微塵眾， 則非微塵眾，是名微塵眾。世尊！ 如來所說三千大千世界，則非世界，是名世界。 何以故？若世界實有者，則是一合相。 如來說一合相，則非一合相，是名一合相。」「須菩提！ 一合相者，則是不可說，但凡夫之人貪著其事。

“Subhūti, if a good man [kulaputra] or good woman [kuladuhitā] disintegrated three thousand great thousand-worlds [trisāhasramahāsāhasre lokadhātau] into atoms [paramāṇu], would these atoms be very many [bahu] in number?” “They would be extremely many [asaṃkhyeya], Bhagavān. Why? If this multitude of atoms truly existed, then the Buddha would not speak of a multitude of atoms. Yet the Buddha does speak of a multitude of atoms, and therefore the multitude of atoms spoken of by the Buddha is not a multitude of atoms, and is thus called a multitude of atoms. Bhagavān, the three thousand great thousand-worlds that the Tathāgata speaks of are not worlds, and are thus called worlds [lokadhāturiti]. Why? The existence of these worlds [lokadhāturabhaviṣyat] is like a single unified appearance. Why? The unified appearance that the Tathāgata speaks of is not a unified appearance, and is thus called the unified appearance.” “Subhūti, one who is of the unified characteristic is unable to speak it, and yet ordinary people greedily wish to acquire it [piṇḍagrāha].

<h4>Comments</h4>
Here the Buddha is explaining that anything is made of an aggregation of many other things using the universe as an example. But in the analogy the universe represents the mind and the dust represents delusions. Hui Neng says,

<div class="commentary">The mind is the root of good and evil. It can be foolish or wise. Its movement and stillness cannot be fathomed. It is vast and without borders. Thus it is called a universe. 
(Red Pine 2009, p 413 translation from Hui Neng. Exegesis on the Diamond Sutra 金剛經解義, Manji 0459)

In the English text the word atom translates the Chinese 微塵, Sanskrit paramāṇu. The phrase extremely many translates the Chinese 甚多. This is represented in the Sanskrit text by the very large number asaṃkhyeya. The word many translates the Chinese 多, Sanskrit bahu. The words and phrases speak, spoken to be, and called translate the Chinese word 說, Sanskrit bhāṣita, except where it translates one instance of nāma.
