<h3>Receiving and maintaining the Dharma 如法受持分</h3>
<h4>Text 原文本</h4>
爾時，須菩提白佛言：「世尊！ 當何名此經？我等云何奉持？」　佛告須菩提：「是經名為“ 金剛般若波羅蜜”。以是名字，汝當奉持。

Subhūti asked the Buddha, “Bhagavān, by what name [nāma] should we revere and maintain this sūtra?” The Buddha told Subhūti, “This sūtra is called [nāma] the Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā, and by this name you should revere and maintain it. Why is it called this? Subhūti, this Prajñāpāramitā spoken by the Buddha is not a perfection [apāramitā] of prajñā.”

Sanskrit: evamukte āyuṣmān subhūtirbhagavantametadavocat-ko nāma ayaṃ bhagavan dharmaparyāyaḥ, kathaṃ cainaṃ dhārayāmi ? evamukte bhagavānāyuṣmantaṃ subhūtimetadavocat- prajñāpāramitā nāmāyaṃ subhūte dharmaparyāyaḥ| evaṃ cainaṃ dhāraya| tatkasya hetoḥ ? yaiva subhūte prajñāpāramitā tathāgatena bhāṣitā, saiva apāramitā tathāgatena bhāṣitā| tenocyate prajñāpāramiteti||

<h4>Comments</h4>
Some Sanskrit versions name the sūtra simply as Prajñāpāramitā without mention of Vajracchedikā but it is mentioned in this version.

所以者何？須菩提！佛說般若波羅蜜， 則非般若波羅蜜。須菩提！於意云何？如來有所說法不？」 須菩提白佛言：「世尊！如來無所說。」

”Subhūti, what do you think? Has the Tathāgata actually spoken any dharma?” Subhūti replied, “Bhagavān, the Tathāgata has not spoken.”

Sanskrit: tatkiṃ manyase subhūte-api nu asti sa kaściddharmo yastathāgatena bhāṣitaḥ ? subhūtirāha-no hīdaṃ bhagavan| nāsti sa kaściddharmo yastathāgatena bhāṣitaḥ||

<h4>Comments</h4>
The Chinese version of this sentence reads Prajñāpāramitā 般若波羅蜜 instead of dhárma, as the Sanskrit version does.

「須菩提！ 於意云何？三千大千世界所有微塵是為多不？」 須菩提言：「甚多，世尊！」　「須菩提！諸微塵， 如來說非微塵，是名微塵。如來說世界，非世界， 是名世界。

“Subhūti, what do you think? Are there very many atoms contained in three thousand great thousand-worlds [trisāhasramahāsāhasre lokadhātau]?” Subhūti replied, “There are extremely many, Bhagavān.” “Subhūti, the atoms spoken of by the Tathāgata are not atoms, and are thus called atoms. The worlds spoken of by the Tathāgata are not worlds [lokadhātu], and are thus called worlds [lokadhātu].”

Sanskrit: bhagavānāha-tatkiṃ manyase subhūte-yāvat trisāhasramahāsāhasre lokadhātau pṛthivīrajaḥ kaccit, tadbahu bhavet ? subhūtirāha-bahu bhagavan, bahu sugata pṛthivīrajo bhavet| tatkasya hetoḥ ? yattadbhagavan pṛthivīrajastathāgatena bhāṣitam, arajastadbhagavaṃstathāgatena bhāṣitam| tenocyate pṛthivīraja iti| yo'pyasau lokadhātustathāgatena bhāṣitaḥ, adhātuḥ sa tathāgatena bhāṣitaḥ| tenocyate lokadhāturiti||

<h4>Comments</h4>
The Buddha mentioned the chiliocosm in Chapter 8 and gave an analogy on filling as many chiliocosms as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River in Section 11.

<h4>Text</h4>
「須菩提！ 於意云何？可以三十二相見如來不？」　「不也，世尊！ 不可以三十二相得見如來。何以故？如來說三十二相， 即是非相，是名三十二相。」

Subhūti, what do you think? Can the Tathāgata be seen by means of the Thirty-two Marks?” “No, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata cannot be seen by means of the Thirty-two Marks. Why? The Thirty-two Marks that the Tathāgata speaks of are not marks, and are thus called the Thirty-two Marks.”

Sanskrit: bhagavānāha- tatkiṃ manyase subhūte dvātriṃśanmahāpuruṣalakṣaṇaistathāgato'rhan samyaksaṃbuddho draṣṭavyaḥ ? subhūtirāha-no hīdaṃ bhagavan| dvātriṃśanmahāpuruṣalakṣaṇaistathāgato'rhan samyaksaṃbuddho draṣṭavyaḥ| tatkasya hetoḥ ? yāni hi tāni bhagavan dvātriṃśanmahāpuruṣalakṣaṇāni tathāgatena bhāṣitāni, alakṣaṇāni tāni bhagavaṃstathāgatena bhāṣitāni| tenocyante dvātriṃśanmahāpuruṣalakṣaṇānīti||

<h4>Comments</h4>
The Buddha want us to transcend appearance. This was mentioned  bodily marks in Section 5 but did not specifically state the 32 bodily marks there. Bodily marks is discussed further in Section 20 and Section 26.

「須菩提！ 若有善男子、善女人，以恆河沙等身命布施； 若復有人，於此經中，乃至受持四句偈等， 為他人說，其福甚多。」

“Subhūti, suppose there were a good man or good woman who, in the practice of giving [dāna], gave his or her body away as many times as there are sand grains in the Ganges River [gaṅgā]. If there are people who accept and maintain even a four-line gāthā from within this sūtra, then the merits [puṇya] of this are far greater.”

Sanskrit: bhagavānāha-yaśca khalu punaḥ subhūte strī vā puruṣo vā dine dine gaṅgānadīvālukāsamānātmabhāvān parityajet, evaṃ parityajan gaṅgānadīvālukāsamān kalpāṃstānātmabhāvān parityajet, yaśca ito dharmaparyāyadantaśaścatuṣpādikāmapi gāthāmudgṛhyaparebhyo deśayet saṃprakāśayet, ayameva tatonidānaṃ bahutaraṃ puṇyaskandhaṃ prasunuyādaprameyamasaṃkhyeyam||13||

<h4>Comments</h4>
The Buddha is making an analogy here to the practice of non-self, letting go of the self.

There is a lot of repetation from earlier sections in this section. This is typical of teachings that are transmitted orally. In Indian religions there is a lot of emphasis on oral teachings and learning by listening. (Mittal and Thursby 2006, p18) This can be seen in the many Sanskrit terms related to learning and cultivation by listening that we do not have equivalents for in English. For example śrutamayīprajñā (wisdom from wisdom from listening 聞慧), śrotravijñāna (auditory consciousness 耳識), śrāvaka (literally, a listener but often referring to a distinguished disciple of the Buddha 聲聞), and Vaiśravaṇa (literally, the deva who listens a lot but referring to the leader of the Heavenly Kings 多聞天).
