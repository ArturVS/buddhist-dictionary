### Summary
Then Gautamī said to all the bhikṣuṇīs and all virtuous women, we should sincerely follow Venerable Ananda's lead. If there are women who desire peace and auspicious karmic rewards then on the second day of the eighth month and the eighth day of the eighth month they should dress in clean clothes, sincerely uphold the eight precepts, including eating vegetarian food, and be diligent all twenty four hours of the day. Through the power of Anubhāva, Ananda help us have our wishes fulfilled.
