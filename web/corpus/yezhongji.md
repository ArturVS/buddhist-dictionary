### English translation

Shihu liked to glorify the Buddha with incalculable extravagances. He commissioned an altar-carriage. In breadth, it was more than a zhang (approximately 10 feet), in length two zhang, with a golden Buddha image on top of a flat four-wheeled cart and nine dragons above that. A wooden figure of a monk was placed before the Buddha, and all round the Buddha were more than ten monks, each a bit more than two feet in height, all wearing white kaṣāyas. When the cart moved, the nine dragons would spew water over the image of the Buddha, and the monk standing in front of the Buddha would rub the area between the Buddha’s heart and his abdomen, as if washing a newborn. The other ten-odd monks would circumambulate the Buddha. As each would come just in front of the Buddha, he would do obeisance, then, taking incense in his hand, deposit it in a censer. When the cart stopped, so would the activity.

### Notes

This passage is line 50 of the document Ye Zhong Ji.

石虎性好佞佛，眾巧奢靡，不可紀也。嘗作檀車，廣丈餘，長二丈，四輪。作金佛像，坐於車上，九龍吐水灌之。又作木道人，恒以手摩佛心腹之間。又十餘木道人，長二尺。餘皆披袈裟繞佛行，當佛前，輒揖禮佛。又以手撮香投爐中，與人無異。車行則木人行，龍吐水，車止則止。亦解飛所造也。
