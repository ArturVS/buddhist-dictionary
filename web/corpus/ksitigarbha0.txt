<h3>Introduction</h3>
The Sūtra of the Great Vow of Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva (Kṣitigarbha Sūtra) is a story about the Buddha teaching to his mother in the Palace of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven about the merits of Kṣitigarbha. It was translated into Chinese, assumedly from Sanskrit, by the monk Śiksānanda from Khotan circa 700. Some details of Śiksānanda's life are given in Scroll 2 of the Song Biographies of Eminent Monks (Taisho Tripiṭaka Vol. 50, No. 2061). The Chinese and English text is shown below. The brief biography of Śiksānanda shows that Empress Wu Ze Tian was an important influence on Buddhist translations at the time that this work was translated. Śiksānanda is best known for leading the translation of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra, a monumental translation work commissioned by the empress.

This sutra is one of the main sources of knowledge about Kṣitigarbha. Kṣitigarbha is known as the bodhisattva of the great vow and in this sūtra we find out what that great vow is. He is described as a bodhisattva that has unimaginable spiritual power to save people and as a role model, who helps people over countless kalpas in the remote past without any thought of the cost to himself. The great vow is to save all sentient beings before Kṣitigarbha becomes a Buddha. Since sentient beings keep committing wrongdoings that lead them back into evil paths Kṣitigarbha has to keep re-saving them and has been doing so for countless eons. Most of the beings that he saves are responsible for their own suffering through poor conduct in the present or previous lives, which shows that Kṣitigarbha is a great being with infinite compassion.

The main figures in the sūtra are Śākyamuni Buddha, his mother Queen Māyā, Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva, Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, and Yama. It is a Mahāyāna sutra.

Chapter 1 gives the setting for the sūtra in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, including a detailed description of the beings in the assembly. Mañjuśrī asks the Buddha to tell the assembly about Kṣitigarbha and his vows.

In Chapter 2 the innumerable division bodies (Chinese: 分身) of Kṣitigarbha gather in the palace. Kṣitigarbha uses Śākyamuni Buddha's power to create many division bodies to save as many sentient beings as possible. The concept of karmic retribution (Sanskrit: karmaphala, Chinese: 業報) or karmic cause and effect is introduced. This chapter explains that Kṣitigarbha saves people by teaching and transforming (Sanskrit: avavāda, Chinese: 教化). Beings need teaching to understand the principle of karma and its result and transformation to overcome their bad habits.

In Chapter 3 Queen Māyā asks Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva to talk about the karmic conditions of beings. Kṣitigarbha talks about karma, as requested, and also tells about the terrors of Avīci Hell and the tortures that sinners suffer there. Avīci Hell (Chinese: 無間地獄) is characterized by uninterupted torment.

In Chapter 4 the Buddha tells a story about a girls filial piety and describes Buddhist practices that can help prevent her mother from being reborn in an evil realm. The term karmic results (Sanskrit: vipāka, Chinese 果報) is first used in this chapter. Karmic results can be positive or negative. In Chapter 4 the girls mother suffers negative karmic results from the killing and slandering that she practiced in a previous life and says that she repeatedly fell into a great hell as a result of this. Her daugther helps her escape from this cycle by making offerings to Pure Lotus Eyes Tathāgata. Negative karmic results are often described using the term retribution (Sanskrit: aniṣṭo-vipāka, Chinese: 罪報) from the Sanskrit aniṣṭa meaning bad or leading to hell.

In Chapter 5 Samantabhadra Bodhisattva asks Kṣitigarbha to explain the suffering that sentient beings may have to endure for committing unwholesome acts and to name the different hells.

In Chapter 6 the Buddha praises Kṣitigarbha for his conduct in saving sentient beings over countless kalpas using many skillful means (Sanskrit: upāya, Chinese: 方便). It describes the practices of copying sutras and making sculptures of Buddhas as generating positive karmic results (Sanskrit: vipāka, Chinese 果报).

In Chapter 7 Kṣitigarbha explains practices that people should perform, especially those nearing death or those people who have family members nearing death. They should especially be careful to not harm or kill other living beings. He explains how some (one seventh) of the merit from good actions by the family members can be transferred to the dying person although most of the merit will be retained by those performing the virtuous deeds.

Chapter 8 narrates the praise of Yama and his followers for Kṣitigarbha. Yama (Chinese: 閻羅王) is a Hindu and Buddhist lord of death. Yama is presented as a benevolent figure in a similar way to the Upanishads. It is people's own karmic conditions that lead them to be reborn in evil realms rather than Yama's wish to send them there.

Chapter 9 describes the merit and blessings obtained from reciting or hearing a Buddha's name. The Sanskrit puṇya (Chinese: 福), which may be translated as virtue or merit is the central concept of this chapter. This refers to conduct that can lead to spiritual liberation, such as giving and honoring Buddhas and bodhisattvas by reciting their names and making offerings.

Chapter 10 discusses the practice of dāna (giving) and the merit attained from it. Kṣitigarbha asks the Buddha why some beings practice little dāna and some practice a lot. The Buddha explains the comparative merit gained from practicing dāna and from transferring merit (Sanskrit: pariṇāmanā, Chinese in the text is 迴向 but a more common written form is 回向). The chapter says that if a person practices dāna by making offerings, repairing stūpas and temples, or preserving sūtras and they transfer the transfer [dedicate] the merits to the Dhárma Realm [the entire world] for these benevolent actions then the merit [puṇya] will be such that they will enjoy supreme and wonderful bliss for a hundred thousand lifetimes. However, if the merit is only transferred to their immediate family dependents or only for their own benefit then the karmic results will only result in three lifetimes of bliss. For giving up one they will gain a ten-thousand-fold reward. This is one of the key points of the sūtra and of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

In Chapter 11 the Earth Goddess Prthivī describes the ten benefits obtained by people who make offerings, worship, and praise Kṣitigarbha. These include protection from having a premature death and living in peace.

Chapter 12 describes the trillions of light rays emitted from the ūrṇā in the Buddha's forehead. An ūrṇā is one of the thirty two marks of excellence of a Buddha, which is a tuft of white hair in between his eyebrows. The Buddha converses with Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, describing practices for obtaining merit, including one where Kṣitigarbha will bless disciples with holy water (Chinese: 授灌頂水).

In Chapter 13 the Buddha entrusts the care of all sentient beings in the Three Realms to Kṣitigarbha. He summarizes the twenty eight benefits of following the practices described in the sūtra.

唐洛陽大遍空寺實叉難陀傳

Biography of Śiksānanda, Da Bian Kong Temple, Luoyang, Tang Dynasty

釋實叉難陀。一雲施乞叉難陀。華言學喜。蔥嶺北于闐人也。智度恢曠風格不群。善大小乘旁通異學。天后明揚佛日崇重大乘。以華嚴舊經處會未備。遠聞于闐有斯梵本。發使求訪並請譯人。叉與經夾同臻帝闕。以證聖元年乙未。於東都大內大遍空寺翻譯。天后親臨法座煥發序文。自運仙毫首題名品。南印度沙門菩提流志沙門義淨同宣梵本。後付沙門復禮法藏等。於佛授記寺譯成八十卷。聖曆二年功畢。

The translator Śiksānanda was also known as Shī Qǐ Chā Nán Tuó. He was fond of studying Chinese language. He came from Khotan on the northern side of the Pamirs. There are few people with his vast knowledge and particular style. He liked both Mahayana and Theravada and was equally well conversed in both. However, the empress publically promoted and more highly esteemed Mahayana. It was understood that the old version of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra was not adequate. It was heard that there was a Sanskrit version in far away in Khotan. So an emisary was sent to inquire about this. The sūtra reached the imperial gate on the first year of the [Empress Wu Ze Tian's] Zheng Sheng reign [695]. It was translated at Da Bian Kong Temple in Luoyang. The empress wrote the preface in person, which she signed using the immortal brush. The sūtra was translated [by Śiksānanda] together with Yi Jing and Bodhiruci, from Southern India. Afterwards the work was given to Fa Zang [lived 643—712 CE]. The translation was completed at Vyakarana Temple in a total of 80 scrolls in the second year of the Sheng Li reign [699].

至久視庚子駕幸潁川三陽宮诏叉譯大乘入楞伽經。天后復製序焉。又於京師清禪寺及東都佛授記寺。譯文殊授記等經。前後總出一十九部沙門波崙玄軌等筆受。沙門復禮等綴文。沙門法寶恒景等證義。太子中舍賈膺福監護。

In the Jiu Shi reign the San Yang Palace at the Ying River in Jia Xing received an imperial order to translate the Lankavatara Sūtra. The empress once again wrote the preface at the capital [Chang'an] at Qing Chan Temple and once again at Vyakarana Temple in Luoyang. The Manjusri and Vyakarana sutras were also translated. Nineteen monks, including Bo Lun and Xuan Gui, were arranged to do the work. After they gracefully completed the texts monks Fa Bao and Heng Jing proof read them. Crown Prince Zhong [舍賈膺???] virtuously acted as guardian.

長安四年。叉以母氏衰老思歸慰覲。錶書再上方俞敕禦史霍嗣光送至 于闐。暨和帝龍興有敕再徵。景龍二年達於京輦。帝屈萬乘之尊。親迎於開遠門外。傾都緇侶備幡幢導引。仍飾青象令乘之入城。敕於大薦福寺安置。未遑翻譯。

In the fourth year of the Chang'an reign [705] because of his mother's weak and feeble condition he sought permission from the empress to ask for leave to return to his place of birth. The records indicate [霍嗣光 ???] that Śiksānanda was again sent for in Khotan by the empress. The [龍興??] imperial orders required him to make the long journey back [to Chang'an]. In the second year of the Jing Long reign [of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, 709] an imperial carraige was sent for him from the capital [Chang'an]. The emperor bowed many times in respect to him when he personally went to greet Śiksānanda outside the Kai Yuan City Gate. A number of monks in the capital prepared a banner [導引 ??] to decorate the elephant that he rode into the city. Imperial orders established a residence for him at Jian Fu Temple for him to perform translation activities.

遘疾彌留以景雲元年十月十二日。右脅累足而終。春秋五十九歲。有诏聽依外國法葬。十一月十二日於開遠門外古然燈臺焚之。薪盡火滅其舌猶存。十二月二十三日。門人悲智敕使哥舒道元。送其餘骸及斯靈舌還歸于闐。起塔供養。後人復於茶毘之所起七層塔。土俗號為華嚴三藏塔焉。

He unexpected fell seriously ill on the 12th day of the 10th month in the first year of the Jing Yun reign [of Emperor Ruizong of Tang, 711]. (右脅累足而終 ???). In the end he died at the age of 59 years. The imperial order called for a foreign style Buddhist funeral service. His body was cremated on the 12th day of the 11th month outside the Kai Yuan City Gate on the Dipankara Buddha Platform. When the fuel was exhausted only his tongue was remaining. On the 23rd day of the 12 month his Dhárma brothers learned that their brother's [敕使哥舒道元 ???] remains would be sent back to Khotan by imperial order. A seven stoy pagoda was built as an offering so later generations could [茶毘??]. The common name for the pagoda is the Avatamsaka Sūtra Tripiṭaka Pagoda.
