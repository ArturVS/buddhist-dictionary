<h3>Transforming the unreal 應化非真分</h3>

「須菩提！ 若有人以滿無量阿僧祇世界七寶持用布施， 若有善男子、善女人，發菩薩心者，持於此經， 乃至四句偈等，受持讀誦，為人演說，其福勝彼。

“Subhūti, suppose someone filled immeasurable, innumerable [asaṃkhyeya] worlds with the Seven Precious Jewels, and then gave these away in the practice of giving [dāna]. If a good man [kulaputra] or good woman [kuladuhitā] develops the mind of a bodhisattva and maintains this sūtra, even with as little as a four-line gāthā, and accepts, maintains, studies, recites, and explains it to others, then the merits [puṇya] of this surpass the others.

Sanskrit: yaśca khalu punaḥ subhūte bodhisattvo mahāsattvo'prameyānasaṃkhyeyāṃllokadhātūn saptaratnaparipūrṇaṃ kṛtvā tathāgatebhyo'rhadbhayaḥ samyaksaṃbuddhebhyo dānaṃ dadyāt, yaśca kulaputro vā kuladuhitā vā itaḥ prajñāpāramitāyā dharmaparyāyādantaśaścatuṣpādikāmapi gāthāmudgṛhya dhārayeddeśayedvācayet paryavāpnuyāt, parebhyaśca vistareṇa saṃprakāśayet, ayameva tatonidānaṃ bahutaraṃ puṇyaskandhaṃ prasunuyādaprameyamasaṃkhyeyam|

In the English text the phrase innumerable translates the Chinese 阿僧祇, Sanskrit asaṃkhyeya.

云何為人演說？不取於相，如如不動。何以故？ 「一切有為法，　　如夢、幻、泡、影， 如露亦如電，　　應作如是觀。」

How should one explain it? Without grasping at characteristics, in unmoving suchness. For what reason?

All conditioned dharmas

Are like dreams [svapna], illusions [timira], bubbles, or shadows;

Like drops of dew, or flashes of lightning;

Thusly [tathā] should they be contemplated.

Sanskrit: kathaṃ ca saṃprakāśayet ? tadyathākāśe-

Sanskrit: tārakā timiraṃ dīpo māyāvaśyāya budbudam|

Sanskrit: svapnaṃ ca vidyudabhraṃ ca evaṃ draṣṭavya saṃskṛtam||

Sanskrit: tathā prakāśayet, tenocyate saṃprakāśayediti||

All worldly phenomena and transitory. In his commentary on the Diamond Sūtra Hsing Yun writes,

Lightening is fleeting, there just for an instant, like time itself. The past, present, and future pass away quite quickly. Human life is also like lightening, for life exists in that short moment of breathing in and out. Once the breath stops, life is no more. 
(Hsing Yun 2012, p 95)

The word thus translates 如是 Sanskrit tathā.

Instead of dreams, the Sanskrit version mentions stars (Sanskrit: tārakā). (Conze 1958, p 70)

佛說是經已，長老須菩提及諸比丘、比丘尼、 優婆塞、優婆夷，一切世間天、人、阿修羅， 聞佛所說，皆大歡喜，信受奉行。

After the Buddha had spoken this sūtra, then Elder [sthavira] Subhūti along with all the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and the devas, humans, and asuras from every world, heard what the Buddha had said. With great bliss, they believed, accepted, and reverently practiced in accordance.

<h4>Comments</h4>
The Sanskrit version also mentions bodhisattvas and gandharvas, which are a kind of mythical being that guard the Truth (Red Pine 2009, p 436), in the assembly.

The English word Elder translates the Chinese 長老, Sanskrit sthavira.
