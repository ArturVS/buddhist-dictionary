### Summary

The benefit acquired from bathing a Buddha statue can be separated into three parts. Firstly, the money can be used to repair statues. Secondly, the money may be used to build stupas. The third part of the money can be used to support the Sangha. The money must not be used irresponsibly. If somebody uses that money for personal benefit then they will suffer greatly in future lives.
