二月八日，釋氏下生之日，迦文成道之時，信籥之家建八關齋戒，車輪寶蓋，七變八會之燈。至今二月八日平旦，執香花繞城一匝，謂之行城。

The 8th day of the 2nd month is the day on which Śākyamuni descended to his birth, and also the time at which he attained enlightenment. Families that have given themselves up to the faith observe the eight precepts. [There are] carriages with precious canopies, and lanterns of all shapes and varieties. At dawn one makes a circuit of the city, carrying incense and blossoms. This is called “proceeding through the city.
