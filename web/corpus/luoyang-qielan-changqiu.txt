長秋寺 … 作六牙白象負釋迦在虛空中。莊嚴佛事悉用金玉。工作之異難可具陳。四月四日。此像常出。辟邪師子導引其前。吞刀吐火騰驤一面。綵幢上索詭譎不常。奇伎異服冠於都市。像停之處。觀者如堵。迭相踐躍。常有死人。

The Ch’ang-chiu Temple (Temple of the Prolonger of Autumn) … There was a statue of a six-tusked white elephant carrying on its back Sakyamuni in the void. The sumptuous Buddhist decorations were all made of gold or jade, with a distinctive workmanship difficult to describe. As a rule, this statue would be carried out [of the temple] and put on parade on the fourth day of the fourth month, behind such [man-made] animals as pi-hsieh and lions. [Variety shows would be held, featuring] sword-eaters, fire-spitters, galloping horses, flagstaff climbers, and rope-walkers—all being [demonstrations] of unusual skills. Their spectacular techniques and bizarre costumes were unmatched in the capital. Wherever the statue stopped, spectators would encircle it like a wall. Stumbling and trampling on each other, people in the crowd often suffered casualties.
