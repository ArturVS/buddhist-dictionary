佛國記
A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms

自發跡長安至度蔥嶺
Chapter I
From Ch’ang-Gan to the Sandy Desert

西行之始

法顯昔在長安，慨律藏殘缺，於是遂以弘始二年歲在己亥，與慧景、道整、慧應、慧嵬等同契，至天竺尋求戒律。
Fa-hien had been living in Ch’ang-gan. Deploring the mutilated and imperfect state of the collection of the Books of Discipline, in the second year of the period Hwang-che, being the Ke-hae year of the cycle, he entered into an engagement with Kwuy-king, Tao-ching, Hwuy-ying, and Hwuy-wei, that they should go to India and seek for the Disciplinary Rules.

乾歸國　耨檀國　張掖鎮　燉煌
初發跡長安，度隴，至乾歸國夏坐。
After starting from Ch’ang-gan, they passed through Lung, and came to the kingdom of K’een-kwei, where they stopped for the summer retreat. 

夏坐訖，前行至耨檀國。
When that was over, they went forward to the kingdom of Now-t’an, 

度養樓山，至張掖鎮。
crossed the mountain of Yang-low, and reached the emporium of Chang-yih.

張掖大亂，道路不通。
There they found the country so much disturbed that travelling on the roads was impossible for them.

張掖王殷勤遂留爲作檀越。於是與智嚴、慧簡、僧紹、寶雲、僧景等相遇，欣於同志，便共夏坐。
Its king, however, was very attentive to them, kept them (in his capital), and acted the part of their danapati. Here they met with Che-yen, Hwuy-keen, Sang-shao, Pao-yun, and Sang-king; and in pleasant association with them, as bound on the same journey with themselves, they passed the summer retreat (of that year) together,

夏坐訖，復進到燉煌。有塞，東西可八十里，南北四十里。
resuming after it their travelling, and going on to T’un-hwang, (the chief town) in the frontier territory of defence extending for about 80 le from east to west, and about 40 from north to south.

共停一月餘日。法顯等五人隨使先發，復與寶雲等別。
Their company, increased as it had been, halted there for some days more than a month, after which Fa-hien and his four friends started first in the suite of an envoy, having separated (for a time) from Pao-yun and his associates.

燉煌太守李暠供給度沙河。
Le Hao, the prefect of T’un-hwang, had supplied them with the means of crossing the desert (before them),

沙河中多有惡鬼、熱風，遇則皆死，無一全者。
in which there are many evil demons and hot winds. (Travellers) who encounter them perish all to a man.

上無飛鳥，下無走獸。遍望極目，欲求度處，則莫知所擬，唯以死人枯骨爲標識耳。
There is not a bird to be seen in the air above, nor an animal on the ground below. Though you look all round most earnestly to find where you can cross, you know not where to make your choice, the only mark and indication being the dry bones of the dead (left upon the sand).

鄯善國
Chapter II
On to Shen-Shen and Thence to Khoten

行十七日，計可千五百里，得至鄯鄯國。其地崎嶇薄瘠。
After travelling for seventeen days, a distance we may calculate of about 1500 le, (the pilgrims) reached the kingdom of Shen-shen, a country rugged and hilly, with a thin and barren soil.

俗人衣服粗與漢地同，但以氈褐爲異。
The clothes of the common people are coarse, and like those worn in our land of Han, some wearing felt and others coarse serge or cloth of hair; — this was the only difference seen among them.

其國王奉法。可有四千餘僧，悉小乘學。
The king professed (our) Law, and there might be in the country more than four thousand monks, who were all students of the hinayana.

諸國俗人及沙門盡行天竺法，但有精麁。
The common people of this and other kingdoms (in that region), as well as the sramans, all practise the rules of India, only that the latter do so more exactly, and the former more loosely.

從此西行，所經諸國類皆如是。唯國國胡語不同，然出家人皆習天竺書、天竺語。住此一月日。
So (the travellers) found it in all the kingdoms through which they went on their way from this to the west, only that each had its own peculiar barbarous speech. (The monks), however, who had (given up the worldly life) and quitted their families, were all students of Indian books and the Indian language. Here they stayed for about a month, and then proceeded on their journey,

焉夷國
復西北行十五日，到焉夷國。
fifteen days walking to the north-west bringing them to the country of Woo-e.

焉夷國僧亦有四千餘人，皆小乘學，法則齊整。
In this also there were more than four thousand monks, all students of the hinayana. They were very strict in their rules, so that sramans from the territory of Ts’in were all unprepared for their regulations.

秦土沙門至彼都，不預其僧例。法顯得苻行當公孫經理，住二月餘日。於是還與寶雲等共。
Fa-hien, through the management of Foo Kung-sun, /maitre d’hotellerie/, was able to remain (with his company in the monastery where they were received) for more than two months, and here they were rejoined by Pao-yun and his friends. 

爲焉夷國人不修禮儀，遇客甚薄，智嚴、慧簡、慧嵬遂返向高昌，欲求行資。
(At the end of that time) the people of Woo-e neglected the duties of propriety and righteousness, and treated the strangers in so niggardly a manner that Che-yen, Hwuy-keen, and Hwuy-wei went back towards Kao-ch’ang, hoping to obtain there the means of continuing their journey. 

沙行
法顯等蒙苻公孫供給，遂得直進。西南行，路中無居民，沙行艱難，所經之苦，人理莫比。
Fa-hien and the rest, however, through the liberality of Foo Kung-sun, managed to go straight forward in a south-west direction. They found the country uninhabited as they went along. The difficulties which they encountered in crossing the streams and on their route, and the sufferings which they endured, were unparalleled in human experience,

于闐國
Chapter III
Khoten. Processions of Images. The King’s New Monastery.

在道一月五日，得到于闐。
but in the course of a month and five days they succeeded in reaching Yu-teen.

其國豐樂，人民殷盛，盡皆奉法，以法樂相娛。
Yu-teen is a pleasant and prosperous kingdom, with a numerous and flourishing population. The inhabitants all profess our Law, and join together in its religious music for their enjoyment.

衆僧乃數萬人，多大乘學，皆有衆食。
The monks amount to several myriads, most of whom are students of the mahayana. They all receive their food from the common store.

彼國人民星居，家家門前皆起小塔，最小者可高二丈許。
Throughout the country the houses of the people stand apart like (separate) stars, and each family has a small tope reared in front of its door. The smallest of these may be twenty cubits high, or rather more.

作四方僧房，供給客僧及餘所須。
They make (in the monasteries) rooms for monks from all quarters, the use of which is given to travelling monks who may arrive, and who are provided with whatever else they require.

國主安堵法顯等於僧伽藍。僧伽藍名瞿摩帝，是大乘寺，三千僧共犍槌食。
The lord of the country lodged Fa-hien and the others comfortably, and supplied their wants, in a monastery called Gomati, of the mahayana school. Attached to it there are three thousand monks, who are called to their meals by the sound of a bell.

入食堂時，威儀齊肅，次第而坐，一切寂然，器鉢無聲。
When they enter the refectory, their demeanour is marked by a reverent gravity, and they take their seats in regular order, all maintaining a perfect silence. No sound is heard from their alms-bowls and other utensils.

淨人益食不得相喚，但以手指麾。
When any of these pure men require food, they are not allowed to call out (to the attendants) for it, but only make signs with their hands.

慧景、道整、慧達先發，向竭叉國。法顯等欲觀行像，停三月日。
Hwuy-king, Tao-ching, and Hwuy-tah set out in advance towards the country of K’eeh-ch’a; but Fa-hien and the others, wishing to see the procession of images, remained behind for three months. 

其國中十四大僧伽藍，不數小者。
There are in this country four great monasteries, not counting the smaller ones.

從四月一日，城裏便掃灑道路，莊嚴巷陌。
Beginning on the first day of the fourth month, they sweep and water the streets inside the city, making a grand display in the lanes and byways.

其城門上張大幃幕，事事嚴餝，王及夫人、采女皆住其中。
Over the city gate they pitch a large tent, grandly adorned in all possible ways, in which the king and queen, with their ladies brilliantly arrayed, take up their residence (for the time).

瞿摩帝僧是大乘學，王所敬重，最先行像。
The monks of the Gomati monastery, being mahayana students, and held in great reverence by the king, took precedence of all others in the procession. 

離城三四里，作四輪像車，高三丈餘，狀如行殿，七寶莊校，懸繒幡蓋。
At a distance of three or four le from the city, they made a four-wheeled image car, more than thirty cubits high, which looked like the great hall (of a monastery) moving along. The seven precious substances were grandly displayed about it, with silken streamers and canopies hanging all around.

像立車中，二菩薩侍，作諸天侍從，皆以金銀彫瑩，懸於虛空。
The (chief) image stood in the middle of the car, with two Bodhisattvas in attendance upon it, while devas were made to follow in waiting, all brilliantly carved in gold and silver, and hanging in the air.

像去門百步，王脫天冠，易著新衣，徒跣持華香，翼從出城迎像，頭面禮足，散華燒香。
When (the car) was a hundred paces from the gate, the king put off his crown of state, changed his dress for a fresh suit, and with bare feet, carrying in his hands flowers and incense, and with two rows of attending followers, went out at the gate to meet the image; and, with his head and face (bowed to the ground), he did homage at its feet, and then scattered the flowers and burnt the incense. 

像入城時，門樓上夫人、采女遙散衆華，紛紛而下。
When the image was entering the gate, the queen and the brilliant ladies with her in the gallery above scattered far and wide all kinds of flowers, which floated about and fell promiscuously to the ground. 

如是莊嚴供具，車車各異。
In this way everything was done to promote the dignity of the occasion. The carriages of the monasteries were all different, 

一僧伽藍則一日行像。
and each one had its own day for the procession.

白月一日爲始，至十四日行像乃訖。
 (The ceremony) began on the first day of the fourth month, and ended on the fourteenth, 

行像訖，王及夫人乃還宮耳。
after which the king and queen returned to the palace.

其城西七八里有僧伽藍，名王新寺。
Seven or eight le to the west of the city there is what is called the King’s New Monastery,

作來八十年，經三王方成。
the building of which took eighty years, and extended over three reigns.

可高二十五丈，彫文刻鏤，金銀覆上，衆寶合成。
It may be 250 cubits in height, rich in elegant carving and inlaid work, covered above with gold and silver, and finished throughout with a combination of all the precious substances.

塔後作佛堂，莊嚴妙好，樑柱、戶扇、䆫牖，皆以金薄。
Behind the tope there has been built a Hall of Buddha,15 of the utmost magnificence and beauty, the beams, pillars, venetianed doors, and windows being all overlaid with gold-leaf.

別作僧房，亦嚴麗整餝，非言可盡。
Besides this, the apartments for the monks are imposingly and elegantly decorated, beyond the power of words to express.

嶺東六國諸王，所有上價寶物，多作供養，人用者少。
Of whatever things of highest value and preciousness the kings in the six countries on the east of the (Ts’ung) range of mountains16 are possessed, they contribute the greater portion (to this monastery), using but a small portion of them themselves.

子合國　於麾國
Chapter IV
Through the Ts’ung or “Onion” Mountains to K’eeh-Ch’a; — Probably Skardo, or Some City More to the East in Ladak

既過四月行像，僧韶一人，隨胡道人向罽賓。
When the processions of images in the fourth month were over, Sang-shao, by himself alone, followed a Tartar who was an earnest follower of the Law, and proceeded towards Kophene.

法顯等進向子合國，在道二十五日，便到其國。
Fa-hien and the others went forward to the kingdom of Tsze-hoh, which it took them twenty-five days to reach.

國王精進。有千餘僧，多大乘學。
Its king was a strenuous follower of our Law, and had (around him) more than a thousand monks, mostly students of the mahayana. 

住此十五日已，於是南行四日，入蔥嶺山，到於麾國安居。
Here (the travellers) abode fifteen days, and then went south for four days, when they found themselves among the Ts’ung-ling mountains, and reached the country of Yu-hwuy, where they halted and kept their retreat.

竭叉國

安居已止，行二十五日，到竭叉國，與慧景等合。
When this was over, they went on among the hills for twenty-five days, and got to K’eeh-ch’a, there rejoining Hwuy-king9 and his two companions.

Chapter V
Great Quinquennial Assembly of Monks. Relics of Buddha. Productions of the Country.

值其國王作般遮越師。般遮越師，漢言五年大會也。
It happened that the king of the country was then holding the pancha parishad, that is, in Chinese, the great quinquennial assembly.

會時請四方沙門，皆來雲集，集已，莊嚴衆僧坐處，懸繒幡蓋，作金銀蓮華，著繒座後，鋪淨坐具。
When this is to be held, the king requests the presence of the Sramans from all quarters (of his kingdom). They come (as if) in clouds; and when they are all assembled, their place of session is grandly decorated. Silken streamers and canopies are hung out in, and water-lilies in gold and silver are made and fixed up behind the places where (the chief of them) are to sit.

王及羣臣如法供養，或一月、二月，或三月，多在春時。
When clean mats have been spread, and they are all seated, the king and his ministers present their offerings according to rule and law. (The assembly takes place), in the first, second, or third month, for the most part in the spring.

王作會已，復勸諸羣臣設供供養，或一日、二日、三日、五日。
After the king has held the assembly, he further exhorts the ministers to make other and special offerings. The doing of this extends over one, two, three, five, or even seven days;

供養都畢，王以所乘馬，鞍勒自副，使國中貴重臣騎之，並諸白㲲、種種珍寶、沙門所須之物，共諸羣臣，發願布施。布施已，還從僧贖。
and when all is finished, he takes his own riding-horse, saddles, bridles, and waits on him himself, while he makes the noblest and most important minister of the kingdom mount him. Then, taking fine white woollen cloth, all sorts of precious things, and articles which the Sramans require, he distributes them among them, uttering vows at the same time along with all his ministers; and when this distribution has taken place, he again redeems (whatever he wishes) from the monks.

其地山寒，不生餘穀，唯熟麥耳。
The country, being among the hills and cold, does not produce the other cereals, and only the wheat gets ripe.

衆僧受歲已，其晨輒霜。故其王每讚衆僧，令麥熟然後受歲。
After the monks have received their annual (portion of this), the mornings suddenly show the hoar-frost, and on this account the king always begs the monks to make the wheat ripen before they receive their portion.

其國中有佛唾壺，以石作，色似佛鉢。
There is in the country a spitoon which belonged to Buddha, made of stone, and in colour like his alms-bowl.

又有佛一齒，國中人爲佛齒起塔。有千餘僧，盡小乘學。
There is also a tooth of Buddha, for which the people have reared a tope, connected with which there are more than a thousand monks and their disciples, all students of the hinayana.

自山以東，俗人被服粗類秦土，亦以氈褐爲異。
To the east of these hills the dress of the common people is of coarse materials, as in our country of Ts’in, but here also6 there were among them the differences of fine woollen cloth and of serge or haircloth.

沙門法用轉轉勝，不可具記。
The rules observed by the Sramans are remarkable, and too numerous to be mentioned in detail.

其國當蔥嶺之中。
The country is in the midst of the Onion range.

自蔥嶺已前，草木果實皆異，唯竹及安石留、甘蔗三物，與漢地同耳。
As you go forward from these mountains, the plants, trees, and fruits are all different from those of the land of Han, excepting only the bamboo, pomegranate, and sugar-cane.

度蔥嶺
Chapter VI
On Towards North India. Darada. Image of Maitreya Bodhisattva.

從此西行向北天竺國。在道一月，得度蔥嶺。
From this (the travellers) went westwards towards North India, and after being on the way for a month, they succeeded in getting across and through the range of the Onion mountains.

蔥嶺冬夏有雪。
The snow rests on them both winter and summer.

又有毒龍，若失其意，則吐毒風，雨雪，飛沙礫石。
There are also among them venomous dragons, which, when provoked, spit forth poisonous winds, and cause showers of snow and storms of sand and gravel.

遇此難者，萬無一全。
Not one in ten thousand of those who encounter these dangers escapes with his life.

彼土人人即名爲雪山也。
The people of the country call the range by the name of “The Snow mountains.”

北天竺、西天竺記遊
陀歷國

度嶺已，到北天竺。始入其境，有一小國名陀歷。亦有衆僧，皆小乘學。
When (the travellers) had got through them, they were in North India, and immediately on entering its borders, found themselves in a small kingdom called T’o-leih,1 where also there were many monks, all students of the hinayana.

其國昔有羅漢，以神足力，將一巧匠上兜術天，觀彌勒菩薩長短、色貌，還下，刻木作像。
In this kingdom there was formerly an Arhan, who by his supernatural power3 took a clever artificer up to the Tushita heaven, to see the height, complexion, and appearance of Maitreya Bodhisattva, and then return and make an image of him in wood.

前後三上觀，然後乃成。像長八丈，足趺八尺，
First and last, this was done three times, and then the image was completed, eighty cubits in height, and eight cubits at the base from knee to knee of the crossed legs. 

齋日常有光明，諸國王競興供養。今故現在。
On fast-days it emits an effulgent light. The kings of the (surrounding) countries vie with one another in presenting offerings to it. Here it is — to be seen now as of old.

Chapter VII
Crossing of the Indus. When Buddhism First Crossed the River for the East

於此順嶺西南行十五日。
The travellers went on to the south-west for fifteen days (at the foot of the mountains, and) following the course of their range.

其道艱岨，崖岸嶮絶，其山唯石，壁立千仞，
The way was difficult and rugged, (running along) a bank exceedingly precipitous, which rose up there, a hill-like wall of rock, 10,000 cubits from the base.

臨之目眩，欲進則投足無所。
When one approaches the edge of it, his eyes become unsteady; and if he wished to go forward in the same direction, there was no place on which he could place his foot;

下有水，名新頭河。
and beneath where the waters of the river called the Indus.

昔人有鑿石通路施傍梯者，凡度七百，度梯已，躡懸緪過河。
In former times men had chiselled paths along the rocks, and distributed ladders on the face of them, to the number altogether of 700, at the bottom of which there was a suspension bridge of ropes, by which the river was crossed,

河兩岸相去減八十步。
its banks being there eighty paces apart.

九譯所絶，漢之張驀、甘英皆不至。
The (place and arrangements) are to be found in the Records of the Nine Interpreters, but neither Chang K’een nor Kan Ying had reached the spot.

衆僧問法顯︰「佛法東過，其始可知耶？」
The monks<sup>6</sup> asked Fa-hien if it could be known when the Law of Buddha first went to the east.

顯雲︰「訪問彼土人，皆雲古老相傳，自立彌勒菩薩像後，便有天竺沙門賷經、律過此河者。
He replied, “When I asked the people of those countries about it, they all said that it had been handed down by their fathers from of old that, after the setting up of the image of Maitreya Bodhisattva, there were Sramans of India who crossed this river, carrying with them Sutras and Books of Discipline.

像立在佛泥洹後三百許年，計於周氏平王時。
Now the image was set up rather more than 300 years after the nirvana<sup>7</sup> of Buddha, which may be referred to the reign of king P’ing of the Chow dynasty.<sup>8</sup>

由茲而言，大教宣流，始自此像。
According to this account we may say that the diffusion of our great doctrines (in the east) began from (the setting up of) this image.

非夫彌勒大士繼軌釋迦，孰能令三寶宣通，邊人識法。
If it had not been through that Maitreya,<sup>9</sup> the great spiritual master<sup>10</sup> (who is to be) the successor of the Sakya, who could have caused the ‘Three Precious Ones’<sup>11</sup> to be proclaimed so far, and the people of those border lands to know our Law?

固知冥運之開，本非人事，則漢明帝之夢，有由而然矣。」
We know of a truth that the opening of (the way for such) a mysterious propagation is not the work of man; and so the dream of the emperor Ming of Han12 had its proper cause.”

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ol>
<li>The Sindhu. We saw in a former note that the earliest name in China for India was Shin-tuh. So, here, the river Indus is called by a name approaching that in sound.</li>
<li>Both Beal and Watters quote from Cunningham (Ladak, pp. 88, 89) the following description of the course of the Indus in these parts, in striking accordance with our author’s account:—“From Skardo to Rongdo, and from Rongdo to Makpou-i-shang-rong, for upwards of 100 miles, the Indus sweeps sullen and dark through a mighty gorge in the mountains, which for wild sublimity is perhaps unequalled. Rongdo means the country of defiles. . . . Between these points the Indus raves from side to side of the gloomy chasm, foaming and chafing with ungovernable fury. Yet even in these inaccessible places has daring and ingenious man triumphed over opposing nature. The yawning abyss is spanned by frail rope bridges, and the narrow ledges of rocks are connected by ladders to form a giddy pathway overhanging the seething cauldron below.”</li>
<li>The Japanese edition has a different reading here from the Chinese copies — one which Remusat (with true critical instinct) conjectured should take the place of the more difficult text with which alone he was acquainted. The “Nine Interpreters” would be a general name for the official interpreters attached to the invading armies of Han in their attempts to penetrate and subdue the regions of the west. The phrase occurs in the memoir of Chang K’een, referred to in the next note.</li>
<li>Chang K’een, a minister of the emperor Woo of Han (B.C. 140-87), is celebrated as the first Chinese who “pierced the void,” and penetrated to “the regions of the west,” corresponding very much to the present Turkestan. Through him, by B.C. 115, a regular intercourse was established between China and the thirty-six kingdoms or states of that quarter; — see Mayers’ Chinese Reader’s Manual, p. 5. The memoir of Chang K’een, translated by Mr. Wylie from the Books of the first Han dynasty, appears in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute, referred to already.</li>
<li>Less is known of Kan Ying than of Chang K’een. Being sent in A.D. 88 by his patron Pan Chao on an embassy to the Roman empire, he only got as far as the Caspian sea, and returned to China. He extended, however, the knowledge of his countrymen with regard to the western regions; — see the memoir of Pan Chao in the Books of the second Han, and Mayers’ Manual, pp. 167, 168.</li>
<li>Where and when? Probably at his first resting-place after crossing the Indus.</li>
<li>This may refer to Sakyamuni’s becoming Buddha on attaining to nirvana, or more probably to his pari-nirvana and death.</li>
<li>As king P’ing’s reign lasted from B.C. 750 to 719, this would place the death of Buddha in the eleventh century B.C., whereas recent inquirers place it between B.C. 480 and 470, a year or two, or a few years, after that of Confucius, so that the two great “Masters” of the east were really contemporaries. But if Rhys Davids be correct, as I think he is, in fixing the date of Buddha’s death within a few years of 412 B.C. (see Manual, p. 213), not to speak of Westergaard’s still lower date, then the Buddha was very considerably the junior of Confucius.</li>
<li>This confirms the words of Eitel, that Maitreya is already controlling the propagation of the faith.</li>
<li>The Chinese characters for this simply mean “the great scholar or officer;” but see Eitel’s Handbook, p. 99, on the term purusha.</li>
<li>“The precious Buddha,” “the precious Law,” and “the precious Monkhood;” Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; the whole being equivalent to Buddhism.</li>
<li>Fa-hien thus endorses the view that Buddhism was introduced into China in this reign, A.D. 58-75. The emperor had his dream in A.D. 61.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Chapter VIII</h3>
烏萇國
Woo-Chang, or Udyana. Monasteries, and Their Ways. Traces of Buddha.

度河便到烏萇國。烏萇國是正北天竺也。
After crossing the river, (the travellers) immediately came to the kingdom of Woo-chang,<sup>1</sup> which is indeed (a part) of North India.

盡作中天竺語，中天竺所謂中國。
The people all use the language of Central India, “Central India” being what we should call the “Middle Kingdom.”

俗人衣服、飲食，亦與中國同。
The food and clothes of the common people are the same as in that Central Kingdom.

佛法甚盛。名衆僧止住處爲僧伽藍，凡有五百僧伽藍，皆小乘學。
The Law of Buddha is very (flourishing in Woo-chang). They call the places where the monks stay (for a time) or reside permanently Sangharamas; and of these there are in all 500, the monks being all students of the hinayana.

若有客比丘到，悉供養三日，三日過已，乃令自求所安常。
When stranger bhikshus<sup>2</sup> arrive at one of them, their wants are supplied for three days, after which they are told to find a resting-place for themselves.

傳言佛至北天竺，即到此國已。佛遺足跡於此。跡或長或短，在人心念，至今猶爾。
There is a tradition that when Buddha came to North India, he came at once to this country, and that here he left a print of his foot, which is long or short according to the ideas of the beholder (on the subject). It exists, and the same thing is true about it, at the present day. 

及曬衣石、度惡龍處，亦悉現在。
Here also are still to be seen the rock on which he dried his clothes, and the place where he converted the wicked dragon.<sup>3</sup>

石高丈四，闊二丈許，一邊平。
The rock is fourteen cubits high, and more than twenty broad, with one side of it smooth.

慧景、慧達、道整三人先發，向佛影那揭國。法顯等住此國夏坐。
Hwuy-king, Hwuy-tah, and Tao-ching went on ahead towards (the place of) Buddha’s shadow in the country of Nagara;<sup>4</sup> but Fa-hien and the others remained in Woo-chang, and kept the summer retreat.<sup>5</sup> That over, they descended south, and arrived in the country of Soo-ho-to.<sup>6</sup>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Udyana, meaning “the Park;” just north of the Punjab, the country along the Subhavastu, now called the Swat; noted for its forests, flowers, and fruits (E. H., p. 153).</li>
<li>Bhikshu is the name for a monk as “living by alms,” a mendicant. All bhikshus call themselves Sramans. Sometimes the two names are used together by our author.</li>
<li>Naga is the Sanskrit name for the Chinese lung or dragon; often meaning a snake, especially the boa. “Chinese Buddhists,” says Eitel, p. 79, “when speaking of nagas as boa spirits, always represent them as enemies of mankind, but when viewing them as deities of rivers, lakes, or oceans, they describe them as piously inclined.” The dragon, however, is in China the symbol of the Sovereign and Sage, a use of it unknown in Buddhism, according to which all nagas need to be converted in order to obtain a higher phase of being. The use of the character too {.}, as here, in the sense of “to convert,” is entirely Buddhistic. The six paramitas are the six virtues which carry men across {.} the great sea of life and death, as the sphere of transmigration to nirvana. With regard to the particular conversion here, Eitel (p. 11) says the Naga’s name was Apatala, the guardian deity of the Subhavastu river, and that he was converted by Sakyamuni shortly before the death of the latter.</li>
<li>In Chinese Na-k’eeh, an ancient kingdom and city on the southern bank of the Cabul river, about thirty miles west of Jellalabad.</li>
<li>We would seem now to be in 403.</li>
<li>Soo-ho-to has not been clearly identified. Beal says that later Buddhist writers include it in Udyana. It must have been between the Indus and the Swat. I suppose it was what we now call Swastene.</li>

Soo-Ho-To. Legend of Buddha.

坐訖，南下，到宿呵多國。其國佛法亦盛。
In that country also Buddhism1 is flourishing.

昔天帝釋試菩薩，化作鷹、鴿，割肉貿鴿處。
There is in it the place where Sakra,<sup>2</sup> Ruler of Devas, in a former age,3 tried the Bodhisattva, by producing4 a hawk (in pursuit of a) dove, when (the Bodhisattva) cut off a piece of his own flesh, and (with it) ransomed the dove.

佛既成道，與諸弟子遊行，語雲︰「此本是吾割肉貿鴿處。」
After Buddha had attained to perfect wisdom,<sup>5</sup> and in travelling about with his disciples (arrived at this spot), he informed them that this was the place where he ransomed the dove with a piece of his own flesh.

國人由是得知，於此處起塔，金銀校餝。
In this way the people of the country became aware of the fact, and on the spot reared a tope, adorned with layers6 of gold and silver plates.

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Buddhism stands for the two Chinese characters {.} {.}, “the Law of Buddha,” and to that rendering of the phrase, which is of frequent occurrence, I will in general adhere. Buddhism is not an adequate rendering of them any more than Christianity would be of {to euaggelion Xristou}. The Fa or Law is the equivalent of dharma comprehending all in the first Basket of the Buddhist teaching — as Dr. Davids says (Hibbert Lectures, p. 44), “its ethics and philosophy, and its system of self-culture;” with the theory of karma, it seems to me, especially underlying it. It has been pointed out (Cunningham’s “Bhilsa Topes,” p. 102) that dharma is the keystone of all king Priyadarsi or Asoka’s edicts. The whole of them are dedicated to the attainment of one object, “the advancement of dharma, or of the Law of Buddha.” His native Chinese afforded no better character than {.} or Law, by which our author could express concisely his idea of the Buddhistic system, as “a law of life,” a directory or system of Rules, by which men could attain to the consummation of their being.</li>
<li>Sakra is a common name for the Brahmanic Indra, adopted by Buddhism into the circle of its own great adherents; — it has been said, “because of his popularity.” He is generally styled, as here, T’een Ti, “God or Ruler of Devas.” He is now the representative of the secular power, the valiant protector of the Buddhist body, but is looked upon as inferior to Sakyamuni, and every Buddhist saint. He appears several times in Fa-hien’s narrative. E. H., pp. 108 and 46.</li>
<li>The Chinese character is {.}, “formerly,” and is often, as in the first sentence of the narrative, simply equivalent to that adverb. At other times it means, as here, “in a former age,” some pre-existent state in the time of a former birth. The incident related is “a Jataka story.”</li>
<li>It occurs at once to the translator to render the characters {.} {.} by “changed himself to.” Such is often their meaning in the sequel, but their use in chapter xxiv may be considered as a crucial test of the meaning which I have given them here.</li>
<li>That is, had become Buddha, or completed his course {.} {.}.</li>
<li>This seems to be the contribution of {.} (or {.}), to the force of the binomial {.} {.}, which is continually occurring.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Chapter X</h3>
犍陀衛國
Gandhara. Legends of Buddha.

從此東下五日行，到揵陀衛國。
The travellers, going downwards from this towards the east, in five days came to the country of Gandhara,<sup>1</sup>

是阿育王子法益所治處。
the place where Dharma-vivardhana,<sup>2</sup> the son of Asoka,<sup>3</sup> ruled. 

佛爲菩薩時，亦於此國以眼施人。
When Buddha was a Bodhisattva, he gave his eyes also for another man here;<sup>4</sup>

其處亦起大塔，金銀校餝。此國人多小乘學。
and at the spot they have also reared a large tope, adorned with layers of gold and silver plates. The people of the country were mostly students of the hinayana.

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Eitel says “an ancient kingdom, corresponding to the region about Dheri and Banjour.” But see note 5.</li>
<li>Dharma-vivardhana is the name in Sanskrit, represented by the Fa Yi {.} {.} of the text.</li>
<li>Asoka is here mentioned for the first time; — the Constantine of the Buddhist society, and famous for the number of viharas and topes which he erected. He was the grandson of Chandragupta (i.q. Sandracottus), a rude adventurer, who at one time was a refugee in the camp of Alexander the Great; and within about twenty years afterwards drove the Greeks out of India, having defeated Seleucus, the Greek ruler of the Indus provinces. He had by that time made himself king of Magadha. His grandson was converted to Buddhism by the bold and patient demeanour of an Arhat whom he had ordered to be buried alive, and became a most zealous supporter of the new faith. Dr. Rhys Davids (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, p. xlvi) says that “Asoka’s coronation can be fixed with absolute certainty within a year or two either way of 267 B.C.”</li>
<li>This also is a Jataka story; but Eitel thinks it may be a myth, constructed from the story of the blinding of Dharma-vivardhana.</li>

<h3>Chapter XI</h3>
竺剎屍羅國
Takshasila. Legends. The Four Great Topes.

自此東行七日，有國名竺剎屍羅。竺剎屍羅，漢言截頭也。
Seven days’ journey from this to the east brought the travellers to the kingdom of Takshasila,<sup>1</sup> which means “the severed head” in the language of China.

佛爲菩薩時，於此處以頭施人，故因以爲名。
Here, when Buddha was a Bodhisattva, he gave away his head to a man;<sup>2</sup> and from this circumstance the kingdom got its name.

復東行二日，至投身餧餓虎處。
Going on further for two days to the east, they came to the place where the Bodhisattva threw down his body to feed a starving tigress.<sup>2</sup>

此二處亦起大塔，皆衆寶校餝。
In these two places also large topes have been built, both adorned with layers of all the precious substances.

諸國王、臣民，競興供養，散華然燈，相繼不絶。
The kings, ministers, and peoples of the kingdoms around vie with one another in making offerings at them. The trains of those who come to scatter flowers and light lamps at them never cease. 

通上二塔，彼方人亦名爲四大塔也。
The nations of those quarters all those (and the other two mentioned before) “the four great topes.”

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ol>
<li>See Julien’s “Methode pour dechiffrer et transcrire les Nomes Sanscrits,” p. 206. Eitel says, “The Taxila of the Greeks, the region near Hoosun Abdaul in lat. 35d 48s N., lon. 72d 44s E. But this identification, I am satisfied, is wrong. Cunningham, indeed, takes credit (“Ancient Geography of India,” pp. 108, 109) for determining this to be the site of Arrian’s Taxila — in the upper Punjab, still existing in the ruins of Shahdheri, between the Indus and Hydaspes (the modern Jhelum). So far he may be correct; but the Takshasila of Fa-hien was on the other, or western side of the Indus; and between the river and Gandhara. It took him, indeed, seven days travelling eastwards to reach it; but we do not know what stoppages he may have made on the way. We must be wary in reckoning distances from his specifications of days.</li>
<li>Two Jataka stories. See the account of the latter in Spence Hardy’s “Manual of Buddhism,” pp. 91, 92. It took place when Buddha had been born as a Brahman in the village of Daliddi; and from the merit of the act, he was next born in a devaloka.</li>

<h3>Chapter XII</h3>
弗樓沙國
Purushapura, or Peshawur. Prophecy About King Kanishka and His Tope. Buddha’s Alms-Bowl. Death of Hwuy-Ying.

從犍陀衛國南行四日，到弗樓沙國。
Going southwards from Gandhara, (the travellers) in four days arrived at the kingdom of Purushapura.1

佛昔將諸弟子遊行此國，語阿難雲︰「吾般泥洹後，當有國王名罽膩伽於此處起塔。」
Formerly, when Buddha was travelling in this country with his disciples, he said to Ananda,2 “After my pari-nirvana,3 there will be a king named Kanishka,4 who shall on this spot build a tope.”

後罽膩伽王出世，出行遊觀，時天帝釋欲開發其意，化作牧牛小兒，當道起塔。王問言：「汝作何等？」
This Kanishka was afterwards born into the world; and (once), when he had gone forth to look about him, Sakra, Ruler of Devas, wishing to excite the idea in his mind, assumed the appearance of a little herd-boy, and was making a tope right in the way (of the king), who asked what sort of thing he was making. 

答曰︰「作佛塔。」
The boy said, “I am making a tope for Buddha.”

王言︰「大善。」
The king said, “Very good;”

於是王即於小兒塔上起塔，高四十餘丈，衆寶校餝。
and immediately, right over the boy’s tope, he (proceeded to) rear another, which was more than four hundred cubits high, and adorned with layers of all the precious substances. 

凡所經見塔廟，壯麗威嚴都無此比。
Of all the topes and temples which (the travellers) saw in their journeyings, there was not one comparable to this in solemn beauty and majestic grandeur.

傳雲︰「閻浮提塔，唯此爲上。」
There is a current saying that this is the finest tope in Jambudvipa.<sup>5</sup>

王作塔成已，小塔即自傍出大塔南，高三尺許。
When the king’s tope was completed, the little tope (of the boy) came out from its side on the south, rather more than three cubits in height.

佛鉢即在此國。
Buddha’s alms-bowl is in this country. 

昔月氏王大興兵衆，來伐此國，欲取佛鉢。
Formerly, a king of Yueh-she<sup>6</sup> raised a large force and invaded this country, wishing to carry the bowl away.

既伏此國已，月氏王等篤信佛法，欲持鉢去，故大興供養。
Having subdued the kingdom, as he and his captains were sincere believers in the Law of Buddha, and wished to carry off the bowl, they proceeded to present their offerings on a great scale.

供養三寶畢，乃校餝大象，置鉢其上，象便伏地不能得前。
When they had done so to the Three Precious Ones, he made a large elephant be grandly caparisoned, and placed the bowl upon it. But the elephant knelt down on the ground, and was unable to go forward.

更作四輪車載鉢，八象共牽，復不能進。
Again he caused a four-wheeled waggon to be prepared in which the bowl was put to be conveyed away. Eight elephants were then yoked to it, and dragged it with their united strength; but neither were they able to go forward.

王知與鉢緣未至，深自愧歎。
The king knew that the time for an association between himself and the bowl had not yet arrived,<sup>7</sup> and was sad and deeply ashamed of himself.

即於此處起塔及僧伽藍，並留鎮守，種種供養。
Forthwith he built a tope at the place and a monastery, and left a guard to watch (the bowl), making all sorts of contributions.

可有七百餘僧，
There may be there more than seven hundred monks.

日將中，衆僧則出鉢，與白衣等種種供養，然後中食。
When it is near midday, they bring out the bowl, and, along with the common people,8 make their various offerings to it, after which they take their midday meal. 

至暮燒香時復爾。
In the evening, at the time of incense, they bring the bowl out again.<sup>9</sup>

可容二斗許，雜色而黑多，四際分明，厚可二分，甚光澤。
It may contain rather more than two pecks, and is of various colours, black predominating, with the seams that show its fourfold composition distinctly marked.<sup>10</sup>

貧人以少華投中便滿；有大富者，欲以多華供養，正復百千萬斛，終不能滿。Its thickness is about the fifth of an inch, and it has a bright and glossy lustre. When poor people throw into it a few flowers, it becomes immediately full, while some very rich people, wishing to make offering of many flowers, might not stop till they had thrown in hundreds, thousands, and myriads of bushels, and yet would not be able to fill it.<sup>11</sup>

寶雲、僧景止供養佛鉢便還。
Pao-yun and Sang-king here merely made their offerings to the alms-bowl, and (then resolved to) go back.

慧景、慧達、道整先向那竭國，供養佛影、佛齒及頂骨。
Hwuy-king, Hwuy-tah, and Tao-ching had gone on before the rest to Negara,<sup>12</sup> to make their offerings at (the places of) Buddha’s shadow, tooth, and the flat-bone of his skull. 

慧景病，道整住看。慧達一人還，於弗樓沙國相見，而慧達、寶雲、僧景遂還秦土。
(There) Hwuy-king fell ill, and Tao-ching remained to look after him, while Hwuy-tah came alone to Purushapura, and saw the others, and (then) he with Pao-yun and Sang-king took their way back to the land of Ts’in.

慧景在佛鉢寺無常。由是，法顯獨進，向佛頂骨所。
Hwuy-king13 came to his end14 in the monastery of Buddha’s alms-bowl, and on this Fa-hien went forward alone towards the place of the flat-bone of Buddha’s skull.

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ol>
<li>The modern Peshawur, lat. 34d 8s N., lon. 71d 30s E.</li>
<li>A first cousin of Sakyamuni, and born at the moment when he attained to Buddhaship. Under Buddha’s teaching, Ananda became an Arhat, and is famous for his strong and accurate memory; and he played an important part at the first council for the formation of the Buddhist canon. The friendship between Sakyamuni and Ananda was very close and tender; and it is impossible to read much of what the dying Buddha said to him and of him, as related in the Maha-pari-nirvana Sutra, without being moved almost to tears. Ananda is to reappear on earth as Buddha in another Kalpa. See E. H., p. 9, and the Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi.</li>
<li>On his attaining to nirvana, Sakyamuni became the Buddha, and had no longer to mourn his being within the circle of transmigration, and could rejoice in an absolute freedom from passion, and a perfect purity. Still he continued to live on for forty-five years, till he attained to pari-nirvana, and had done with all the life of sense and society, and had no more exercise of thought. He died; but whether he absolutely and entirely /ceased/ to be, in any sense of the word /being/, it would be difficult to say. Probably he himself would not and could not have spoken definitely on the point. So far as our use of language is concerned, apart from any assured faith in and hope of immortality, his pari-nirvana was his death.</li>
<li>Kanishka appeared, and began to reign, early in our first century, about A.D. 10. He was the last of three brothers, whose original seat was in Yueh-she, immediately mentioned, or Tukhara. Converted by the sudden appearance of a saint, he became a zealous Buddhist, and patronised the system as liberally as Asoka had done. The finest topes in the north-west of India are ascribed to him; he was certainly a great man and a magnificent sovereign.</li>
<li>Jambudvipa is one of the four great continents of the universe, representing the inhabited world as fancied by the Buddhists, and so called because it resembles in shape the leaves of the jambu tree. It is south of mount Meru, and divided among four fabulous kings (E. H., p. 36). It is often used, as here perhaps, merely as the Buddhist name for India.</li>
<li>This king was perhaps Kanishka himself, Fa-hien mixing up, in an inartistic way, different legends about him. Eitel suggests that a relic of the old name of the country may still exist in that of the Jats or Juts of the present day. A more common name for it is Tukhara, and he observes that the people were the Indo-Scythians of the Greeks, and the Tartars of Chinese writers, who, driven on by the Huns (180 B.C.), conquered Transoxiana, destroyed the Bactrian kingdom (126 B.C.), and finally conquered the Punjab, Cashmere, and great part of India, their greatest king being Kanishak (E. H., p. 152).</li>
<li>Watters, clearly understanding the thought of the author in this sentence, renders —“his destiny did not extend to a connexion with the bowl;” but the term “destiny” suggests a controlling or directing power without. The king thought that his virtue in the past was not yet sufficient to give him possession of the bowl.</li>
<li>The text is simply “those in white clothes.” This may mean “the laity,” or the “upasakas;” but it is better to take the characters in their common Chinese acceptation, as meaning “commoners,” “men who have no rank.” See in Williams’ Dictionary under {.}.</li>
<li>I do not wonder that Remusat should give for this —“et s’en retournent apres.” But Fa-hien’s use of {.} in the sense of “in the same way” is uniform throughout the narrative.</li>
<li>Hardy’s M. B., p. 183, says:—“The alms-bowl, given by Mahabrahma, having vanished (about the time that Gotama became Buddha), each of the four guardian deities brought him an alms-bowl of emerald, but he did not accept them. They then brought four bowls made of stone, of the colour of the mung fruit; and when each entreated that his own bowl might be accepted, Buddha caused them to appear as if formed into a single bowl, appearing at the upper rim as if placed one within the other.” See the account more correctly given in the “Buddhist Birth Stories,” p. 110.</li>
<li>Compare the narrative in Luke’s Gospel, xxi. 1-4.</li>
<li>See chapter viii.</li>
<li>This, no doubt, should be Hwuy-ying. King was at this time ill in Nagara, and indeed afterwards he dies in crossing the Little Snowy Mountains; but all the texts make him die twice. The confounding of the two names has been pointed out by Chinese critics.</li>
<li>“Came to his end;” i.e., according to the text, “proved the impermanence and uncertainty,” namely, of human life. See Williams’ Dictionary under {.}. The phraseology is wholly Buddhistic.</li>

<h3>Chapter XIII</h3>
那竭國
Nagara. Festival of Buddha’s Skull-Bone. Other Relics, and His Shadow.

西行十六由延，便至那竭國界醯羅城。城中有佛頂骨精舍，盡以金薄、七寶校餝。
Going west for sixteen yojanas,<sup>1</sup> he came to the city He-lo<sup>2</sup> in the borders of the country of Nagara, where there is the flat-bone of Buddha’s skull, deposited in a vihara<sup>3</sup> adorned all over with gold-leaf and the seven sacred substances.

國王敬重頂骨，慮人抄奪，乃取國中豪姓八人，人持一印，印封守護。
The king of the country, revering and honouring the bone, and anxious lest it should be stolen away, has selected eight individuals, representing the great families in the kingdom, and committing to each a seal, with which he should seal (its shrine) and guard (the relic).

清晨，八人俱到，各視其印，然後開戶。
At early dawn these eight men come, and after each has inspected his seal, they open the door.

開戶已，以香汁洗手，出佛頂骨，置精舍外高座上，以七寶圓椹椹下，琉璃鍾覆上，皆珠璣校餝。
This done, they wash their hands with scented water and bring out the bone, which they place outside the vihara, on a lofty platform, where it is supported on a round pedestal of the seven precious substances, and covered with a bell of /lapis lazuli/, both adorned with rows of pearls.

骨黃白色，方圓四寸，其上隆起。
Its colour is of a yellowish white, and it forms an imperfect circle twelve inches round,4 curving upwards to the centre.

每日出後，精舍人則登高樓，擊大鼓，吹螺，敲銅鈸。
Every day, after it has been brought forth, the keepers of the vihara ascend a high gallery, where they beat great drums, blow conchs, and clash their copper cymbals. 

王聞已，則詣精舍，以華香供養。
When the king hears them, he goes to the vihara, and makes his offerings of flowers and incense.

供養已，次第頂戴而去。從東門入，西門出。
When he has done this, he (and his attendants) in order, one after another, (raise the bone), place it (for a moment) on the top of their heads,5 and then depart, going out by the door on the west as they entered by that on the east.

王朝朝如是供養、禮拜，然後聽國政。
The king every morning makes his offerings and performs his worship, and afterwards gives audience on the business of his government.

居士、長者亦先供養，乃修家事。
The chiefs of the Vaisyas6 also make their offerings before they attend to their family affairs. 

日日如是，初無懈惓。
Every day it is so, and there is no remissness in the observance of the custom.

供養都訖，乃還頂骨於精舍。
When all the offerings are over, they replace the bone in the vihara,

中有七寶解脫塔，或開或閇，高五尺許，以盛之。
where there is a vimoksha tope,<sup>7</sup> of the seven precious substances, and rather more than five cubits high, sometimes open, sometimes shut, to contain it.

精舍門前，朝朝恆有賣華香人，凡欲供養者，種種買焉。
In front of the door of the vihara, there are parties who every morning sell flowers and incense,<sup>8</sup> and those who wish to make offerings buy some of all kinds. 

諸國王亦恆遣使供養。
The kings of various countries are also constantly sending messengers with offerings. 

精舍處方四十步，雖復天震地裂，此處不動。
The vihara stands in a square of thirty paces, and though heaven should shake and earth be rent, this place would not move.

從此北行一由延，到那揭國城。
Going on, north from this, for a yojana, (Fa-hien) arrived at the capital of Nagara,

是菩薩本以銀錢𧵍五莖華，供養定光佛處。
the place where the Bodhisattva once purchased with money five stalks of flowers, as an offering to the Dipankara Buddha.<sup>9</sup.

城中亦有佛齒塔，供養如頂骨法。
In the midst of the city there is also the tope of Buddha’s tooth, where offerings are made in the same way as to the flat-bone of his skull.

城東北一由延，到一谷口。有佛錫杖，亦起精舍供養，
A yojana to the north-east of the city brought him to the mouth of a valley, where there is Buddha’s pewter staff;10 and a vihara also has been built at which offerings are made.

杖以牛頭旃檀作，長丈六七許，
The staff is made of Gosirsha Chandana, and is quite sixteen or seventeen cubits long.

以木筒盛之，正復百千人，舉不能移。
It is contained in a wooden tube, and though a hundred or a thousand men ere to (try to) lift it, they could not move it.

入谷口四日西行，有佛僧伽梨精舍供養。
Entering the mouth of the valley, and going west, he found Buddha’s Sanghali,<sup>11</sup> where also there is reared a vihara, and offerings are made. 

彼國土亢旱時，國人相率出衣，禮拜供養，天即大雨。
It is a custom of the country when there is a great drought, for the people to collect in crowds, bring out the robe, pay worship to it, and make offerings, on which there is immediately a great rain from the sky.

那竭城南半由延，有石室，搏山西南向，佛留影此中。
South of the city, half a yojana, there is a rock-cavern, in a great hill fronting the south-west; and here it was that Buddha left his shadow. 

去十餘步觀之，如佛真形，金色相好，光明炳著，轉近轉微，髣髴如有。
Looking at it from a distance of more than ten paces, you seem to see Buddha’s real form, with his complexion of gold, and his characteristic marks<sup>12</sup> in their nicety clearly and brightly displayed. The nearer you approach, however, the fainter it becomes, as if it were only in your fancy. 

諸方國王遣工畫師模寫，莫能及。
When the kings from the regions all around have sent skilful artists to take a copy, none of them have been able to do so.

彼國人傳雲，千佛盡當於此留影。
Among the people of the country there is a saying current that “the thousand Buddhas<sup>13</sup> must all leave their shadows here.”

影西四百步許，佛在時剃髮剪爪。佛自與諸弟子共造塔，高七八丈，以爲將來塔法，今猶在。
Rather more than four hundred paces west from the shadow, when Buddha was at the spot, he shaved his hair and clipt his nails, and proceeded, along with his disciples, to build a tope seventy or eighty cubits high, to be a model for all future topes; and it is still existing. 

邊有寺，寺中有七百餘僧。
By the side of it there is a monastery, with more than seven hundred monks in it.

此處有諸羅漢、辟支佛塔乃千數。
At this place there are as many as a thousand topes14 of Arhans and Pratyeka Buddhas.<sup>15</sup>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Now in India, Fa-hien used the Indian measure of distance; but it is not possible to determine exactly what its length then was. The estimates of it are very different, and vary from four and a half or five miles to seven, and sometimes more. See the subject exhaustively treated in Davids’ “Ceylon Coins and Measures,” pp. 15-17.</li>
<li>The present Hilda, west of Peshawur, and five miles south of Jellalabad.</li>
<li>“The vihara,” says Hardy, “is the residence of a recluse or priest;” and so Davids:—‘the clean little hut where the mendicant lives.” Our author, however, does not use the Indian name here, but the Chinese characters which express its meaning — tsing shay, “a pure dwelling.” He uses the term occasionally, and evidently, in this sense; more frequently it occurs in his narrative in connexion with the Buddhist relic worship; and at first I translated it by “shrine” and “shrine-house;” but I came to the conclusion, at last, to employ always the Indian name. The first time I saw a shrine-house was, I think, in a monastery near Foo-chow; — a small pyramidical structure, about ten feet high, glittering as if with the precious substances, but all, it seemed to me, of tinsel. It was in a large apartment of the building, having many images in it. The monks said it was the most precious thing in their possession, and that if they opened it, as I begged them to do, there would be a convulsion that would destroy the whole establishment. See E. H., p. 166. The name of the province of Behar was given to it in consequence of its many viharas.</li>
<li>According to the characters, “square, round, four inches.” Hsuan-chwang says it was twelve inches round.</li>
<li>In Williams’ Dictionary, under {.}, the characters, used here, are employed in the phrase for “to degrade an officer,” that is, “to remove the token of his rank worn on the crown of his head;” but to place a thing on the crown is a Buddhistic form of religious homage.</li>
<li>The Vaisyas, or bourgeois caste of Hindu society, are described here as “resident scholars.”</li>
<li>See Eitel’s Handbook under the name vimoksha, which is explained as “the act of self-liberation,” and “the dwelling or state of liberty.” There are eight acts of liberating one’s self from all subjective and objective trammels, and as many states of liberty (vimukti) resulting therefrom. They are eight degrees of self-inanition, and apparently eight stages on the way to nirvana. The tope in the text would be emblematic in some way of the general idea of the mental progress conducting to the Buddhistic consummation of existence.</li>
<li>This incense would be in long “sticks,” small and large, such as are sold to-day throughout China, as you enter the temples.</li>
<li>“The illuminating Buddha,” the twenty-fourth predecessor of Sakyamuni, and who, so long before, gave him the assurance that he would by-and-by be Buddha. See Jataka Tales, p. 23.</li>
<li>The staff was, as immediately appears, of Gosirsha Chandana, or “sandal-wood from the Cow’s-head mountain,” a species of copper-brown sandal-wood, said to be produced most abundantly on a mountain of (the fabulous continent) Ullarakuru, north of mount Meru, which resembles in shape the head of a cow (E. H., pp. 42, 43). It is called a “pewter staff” from having on it a head and rings and pewter. See Watters, “China Review,” viii, pp. 227, 228, and Williams’ Dictionary, under {.}.</li>
<li>Or Sanghati, the double or composite robe, part of a monk’s attire, reaching from the shoulders to the knees, and fastened round the waist (E. H., p. 118).</li>
<li>These were the “marks and beauties” on the person of a supreme Buddha. The rishi Kala Devala saw them on the body of the infant Sakya prince to the number of 328, those on the teeth, which had not yet come out, being visible to his spirit-like eyes (M. B., pp. 148, 149).</li>
<li>Probably=“all Buddhas.”</li>
<li>The number may appear too great. But see what is said on the size of topes in chapter iii, note 4.</li>
<li>In Singhalese, Pase Buddhas; called also Nidana Buddhas, and Pratyeka Jinas, and explained by “individually intelligent,” “completely intelligent,” “intelligent as regards the nidanas.” This, says Eitel (pp. 96, 97), is “a degree of saintship unknown to primitive Buddhism, denoting automats in ascetic life who attain to Buddhaship ‘individually,’ that is, without a teacher, and without being able to save others. As the ideal hermit, the Pratyeka Buddha is compared with the rhinoceros khadga that lives lonely in the wilderness. He is also called Nidana Buddha, as having mastered the twelve nidanas (the twelve links in the everlasting chain of cause and effect in the whole range of existence, the understanding of which solves the riddle of life, revealing the inanity of all forms of existence, and preparing the mind for nirvana). He is also compared to a horse, which, crossing a river, almost buries its body under the water, without, however, touching the bottom of the river. Thus in crossing samsara he ‘suppresses the errors of life and thought, and the effects of habit and passion, without attaining to absolute perfection.’” Whether these Buddhas were unknown, as Eitel says, to primitive Buddhism, may be doubted. See Davids’ Hibbert Lectures, p. 146.</li>

<h3>Chapter XIV</h3>
度小雪山
Death of Hwuy-King in the Little Snowy Mountains. Lo-E. Pohna. Crossing the Indus to the East.

住此冬三月，法顯等三人南度小雪山。
Having stayed there till the third month of winter, Fa-hien and the two others,<sup>1</sup> proceeding southwards, crossed the Little Snowy mountains.<sup>2</sup>

雪山冬夏積雪。
On them the snow lies accumulated both winter and summer.

山北陰中遇寒風暴起，人皆噤戰。
On the north (side) of the mountains, in the shade, they suddenly encountered a cold wind which made them shiver and become unable to speak.

慧景一人不堪復進，口出白沫，語法顯雲︰「我亦不復活，便可時去，勿得俱死。」
Hwuy-king could not go any farther. A white froth came from his mouth, and he said to Fa-hien, “I cannot live any longer. Do you immediately go away, that we do not all die here;”

於是遂終。
and with these words he died.<sup>3</sup>

法顯撫之悲號：「本圖不果，命也奈何！」
Fa-hien stroked the corpse, and cried out piteously, “Our original plan has failed; — it is fate.<sup>4</sup> What can we do?”

復自力前，得過嶺。
He then again exerted himself, and they succeeded in crossing to the south of the range,

羅夷國　跋那國　毗荼國

南到羅夷國。近有三千僧，兼大小乘學。住此夏坐。
and arrived in the kingdom of Lo-e,<sup>5</sup> where there were nearly three thousand monks, students of both the mahayana and hinayana. Here they stayed for the summer retreat,<sup>6</sup>

坐訖，南下，行十日，到跋那國。亦有三千許僧，皆小乘學。
and when that was over, they went on to the south, and ten days’ journey brought them to the kingdom of Poh-na,<sup>7</sup> where there are also more than three thousand monks, all students of the hinayana.

從此東行三日，復渡新頭河，兩岸皆平地。
Proceeding from this place for three days, they again crossed the Indus, where the country on each side was low and level.<sup>8</sup>

<li>A very natural exclamation, but out of place and inconsistent from the lips of Fa-hien. The Chinese character {.}, which he employed, may be rendered rightly by “fate” or “destiny;” but the fate is not unintelligent. The term implies a factor, or fa-tor, and supposes the ordination of Heaven or God. A Confucian idea for the moment overcame his Buddhism.</li>

<h3>Chapter XV</h3>
Bhida. Sympathy of Monks with the Pilgrims.

過河有國，名毗荼。佛法興盛，兼大小乘學。
After they had crossed the river, there was a country named Pe-t’oo,1 where Buddhism was very flourishing, and (the monks) studied both the mahayana and hinayana.

見秦道人往，乃大憐愍，作是言：「如何邊地人，能知出家爲道，遠求佛法？」
When they saw their fellow-disciples from Ts’in passing along, they were moved with great pity and sympathy, and expressed themselves thus: “How is it that these men from a border-land should have learned to become monks,2 and come for the sake of our doctrines from such a distance in search of the Law of Buddha?”

悉供給所須，待之如法。
They supplied them with what they needed, and treated them in accordance with the rules of the Law.

<h4>Notes</h4>

<li>Bhida. Eitel says, “The present Punjab;” i.e. it was a portion of that.</li>
<li>“To come forth from their families;” that is, to become celibates, and adopt the tonsure.</li>

<h3>Chapter XVI</h3>
On to Mathura or Muttra. Condition and Customs of Central India; of the Monks, Viharas, and Monasteries.

從此東南行減八十由延，經歷諸寺甚多，僧衆萬數。
From this place they travelled south-east, passing by a succession of very many monasteries, with a multitude of monks, who might be counted by myriads. 

中天竺、東天竺記遊
摩頭羅國

過是諸處已，到一國，國名摩頭羅。
After passing all these places, they came to a country named Ma-t’aou-lo.<sup>1</sup>

有遙捕那河，河邊左右有二十僧伽藍，可有三千僧，佛法轉盛。
They still followed the course of the P’oo-na<sup>2</sup> river, on the banks of which, left and right, there were twenty monasteries, which might contain three thousand monks; and (here) the Law of Buddha was still more flourishing.

凡沙河已西，天竺諸國，國王皆篤信佛法。
Everywhere, from the Sandy Desert, in all the countries of India, the kings had been firm believers in that Law.

供養衆僧時，則脫天冠，共諸宗親、羣臣手自行食。
When they make their offerings to a community of monks, they take off their royal caps, and along with their relatives and ministers, supply them with food with their own hands.

行食已，鋪氊於地，對上座前坐，於衆僧前不敢坐床。
That done, (the king) has a carpet spread for himself on the ground, and sits down in front of the chairman; — they dare not presume to sit on couches in front of the community.

佛在世時諸王供養法式，相傳至今。
The laws and ways, according to which the kings presented their offerings when Buddha was in the world, have been handed down to the present day.

從是以南，名爲中國。
All south from this is named the Middle Kingdom.<sup>3</sup>

中國寒暑調和，無霜、雪。
In it the cold and heat are finely tempered, and there is neither hoarfrost nor snow.

人民殷樂，無戶籍官法，唯耕王地者乃輸地利，欲去便去，欲住便住。
The people are numerous and happy; they have not to register their households, or attend to any magistrates and their rules; only those who cultivate the royal land have to pay (a portion of) the grain from it. If they want to go, they go; if they want to stay on, they stay.

王治不用刑罔，有罪者但罰其錢，隨事輕重，雖復謀爲惡逆，不過截右手而已。
The king governs without decapitation or (other) corporal punishments. Criminals are simply fined, lightly or heavily, according to the circumstances (of each case). Even in cases of repeated attempts at wicked rebellion, they only have their right hands cut off.

王之侍衛、左右皆有供祿。
The king’s body-guards and attendants all have salaries.

舉國人民悉不殺生，不飲酒，不食蔥䔉，唯除旃荼羅。
Throughout the whole country the people do not kill any living creature, nor drink intoxicating liquor, nor eat onions or garlic. The only exception is that of the Chandalas.<sup>4</sup>

旃荼羅名爲惡人，與人別居，若入城市則擊木以自異，人則識而避之，不相唐突。
That is the name for those who are (held to be) wicked men, and live apart from others. When they enter the gate of a city or a market-place, they strike a piece of wood to make themselves known, so that men know and avoid them, and do not come into contact with them.

國中不養豬、雞，不賣生口，市無屠、酤及估酒者，貨易則用貝齒，唯旃荼羅、獵師賣肉耳。
In that country they do not keep pigs and fowls, and do not sell live cattle; in the markets there are no butchers’ shops and no dealers in intoxicating drink. In buying and selling commodities they use cowries.<sup>5</sup> Only the Chandalas are fishermen and hunters, and sell flesh meat.

自佛般泥洹後，諸國王、長者、居士爲衆僧起精舍供養，供給田宅、園圃、民戶、牛犢，鐵券書録，後王王相傳，無敢廢者，至今不絶。
After Buddha attained to pari-nirvana,<sup>6</sup> the kings of the various countries and the heads of the Vaisyas<sup>7</sup> built viharas for the priests, and endowed them with fields, houses, gardens, and orchards, along with the resident populations and their cattle, the grants being engraved on plates of metal,<sup>8</sup> so that afterwards they were handed down from king to king, without any daring to annul them, and they remain even to the present time.

衆僧住止房舍、床褥、飲食、衣服，都無缺乏，處處皆爾。衆僧常以作功德爲業，及誦經、坐禪。
The regular business of the monks is to perform acts of meritorious virtue, and to recite their Sutras and sit wrapt in meditation.

客僧往到，舊僧迎逆，代檐衣鉢，給洗足水，塗足油，與非時漿，
When stranger monks arrive (at any monastery), the old residents meet and receive them, carry for them their clothes and alms-bowl, give them water to wash their feet, oil with which to anoint them, and the liquid food permitted out of the regular hours.<sup>9</sup>

須臾，息已，復問其臘數，次第得房舍、臥具，種種如法。
When (the stranger) has enjoyed a very brief rest, they further ask the number of years that he has been a monk, after which he receives a sleeping apartment with its appurtenances, according to his regular order, and everything is done for him which the rules prescribe.<sup>10</sup>

衆僧住處，作舍利弗塔、目連、阿難塔，並阿毗曇、律、經塔。Where a community of monks resides, they erect topes to Sariputtra,11 to Maha-maudgalyayana,<sup>12</sup> and to Ananda,</sup>13</sup> and also topes (in honour) of the Abhidharma, the Vinaya, and the Sutras.

安居後一月，諸希福之家勸化供養僧，作非時漿。
A month after the (annual season of) rest, the families which are looking out for blessing stimulate one another14 to make offerings to the monks, and send round to them the liquid food which may be taken out of the ordinary hours.

衆僧大會說法。說法已，供養舍利弗塔，種種香華，通夜然燈。
All the monks come together in a great assembly, and preach the Law;<sup>15</sup> after which offerings are presented at the tope of Sariputtra, with all kinds of flowers and incense. All through the night lamps are kept burning, and skilful musicians are employed to perform.<sup>16</sup>

使彼人作舍利弗本婆羅門時詣佛求出家。
When Sariputtra was a great Brahman, he went to Buddha, and begged (to be permitted) to quit his family (and become a monk).

大目連、大迦葉亦如是。
The great Mugalan and the great Kasyapa<sup>17</sup> also did the same.

諸比丘尼多供養阿難塔，以阿難請世尊聽女人出家故。
The bhikshunis18 for the most part make their offerings at the tope of Ananda, because it was he who requested the World-honoured one to allow females to quit their families (and become nuns).

諸沙彌多供養羅雲。
The Sramaneras<sup>19</sup> mostly make their offerings to Rahula.<sup>20</sup> 

阿毗曇師者，供養阿毗曇。律師者，供養律。
The professors of the Abhidharma make their offerings to it; those of the Vinaya to it.

年年一供養，各自有日。
Every year there is one such offering, and each class has its own day for it.

摩訶衍人則供養般若波羅蜜、文殊師利、觀世音等。
Students of the mahayana present offerings to the Prajna-paramita,<sup>21</sup> to Manjusri,</sup>22</sup> and to Kwan-she-yin.<sup>23</sup>

衆僧受歲竟，長者、居士、婆羅門等各持種種衣物、沙門所須，以布施僧，衆僧亦自各各布施。
When the monks have done receiving their annual tribute (from the harvests),24 the Heads of the Vaisyas and all the Brahmans bring clothes and other such articles as the monks require for use, and distribute among them. The monks, having received them, also proceed to give portions to one another.

佛泥洹已來，聖衆所行威儀法則，相承不紀。
From the nirvana of Buddha,25 the forms of ceremony, laws, and rules, practised by the sacred communities, have been handed down from one generation to another without interruption.

自渡新頭河，至南天竺，迄於南海，四五萬里，皆平坦，無大山川，正有河水耳。
From the place where (the travellers) crossed the Indus to Southern India, and on to the Southern Sea, a distance of forty or fifty thousand le, all is level plain. There are no large hills with streams (among them); there are simply the waters of the rivers.

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Muttra, “the peacock city;” lat. 27d 30s N., lon. 77d 43s E. (Hunter); the birthplace of Krishna, whose emblem is the peacock.</li>
<li>This must be the Jumna, or Yamuna. Why it is called, as here, the P’oo-na has yet to be explained.</li>
<li>In Pali, Majjhima-desa, “the Middle Country.” See Davids’ “Buddhist Birth Stories,” page 61, note.</li>
<li>Eitel (pp. 145, 6) says, “The name Chandalas is explained by ‘butchers,’ ‘wicked men,’ and those who carry ‘the awful flag,’ to warn off their betters; — the lowest and most despised caste of India, members of which, however, when converted, were admitted even into the ranks of the priesthood.”</li>
<li>“Cowries;” {.} {.}, not “shells and ivory,” as one might suppose; but cowries alone, the second term entering into the name from the marks inside the edge of the shell, resembling “the teeth of fishes.”</li>
<li>See chapter xii, note 3, Buddha’s pari-nirvana is equivalent to Buddha’s death.</li>
<li>See chapter xiii, note 6. The order of the characters is different here, but with the same meaning.</li>
<li>See the preparation of such a deed of grant in a special case, as related in chapter xxxix. No doubt in Fa-hien’s time, and long before and after it, it was the custom to engrave such deeds on plates of metal.</li>
<li>“No monk can eat solid food except between sunrise and noon,” and total abstinence from intoxicating drinks is obligatory (Davids’ Manual, p. 163). Food eaten at any other part of the day is called vikala, and forbidden; but a weary traveller might receive unseasonable refreshment, consisting, as Watters has shown (Ch. Rev. viii. 282), of honey, butter, treacle, and sesamum oil.</li>
<li>The expression here is somewhat perplexing; but it occurs again in chapter xxxviii; and the meaning is clear. See Watters, Ch. Rev. viii. 282, 3. The rules are given at length in the Sacred Books of the East, vol. xx, p. 272 and foll., and p. 279 and foll.</li>
<li>Sariputtra (Singh. Seriyut) was one of the principal disciples of Buddha, and indeed the most learned and ingenious of them all, so that he obtained the title of {.} {.}, “knowledge and wisdom.” He is also called Buddha’s “right-hand attendant.” His name is derived from that of his mother Sarika, the wife of Tishya, a native of Nalanda. In Spence Hardy, he often appears under the name of Upatissa (Upa-tishya), derived from his father. Several Sastras are ascribed to him, and indeed the followers of the Abhidharma look on him as their founder. He died before Sakyamuni; but is to reappear as a future Buddha. Eitel, pp. 123, 124.</li>
<li>Mugalan, the Singhalese name of this disciple, is more pronounceable. He also was one of the principal disciples, called Buddha’s “left-hand attendant.” He was distinguished for his power of vision, and his magical powers. The name in the text is derived from the former attribute, and it was by the latter that he took up an artist to Tushita to get a view of Sakyamuni, and so make a statue of him. (Compare the similar story in chap. vi.) He went to hell, and released his mother. He also died before Sakyamuni, and is to reappear as Buddha. Eitel, p. 65.</li>
<li>See chapter xii, note 2.</li>
<li>A passage rather difficult to construe. The “families” would be those more devout than their neighbours.</li>
<li>One rarely hears this preaching in China. It struck me most as I once heard it at Osaka in Japan. There was a pulpit in a large hall of the temple, and the audience sat around on the matted floor. One priest took the pulpit after another; and the hearers nodded their heads occasionally, and indicated their sympathy now and then by an audible “h’m,” which reminded me of Carlyle’s description of meetings of “The Ironsides” of Cromwell.</li>
<li>This last statement is wanting in the Chinese editions.</li>
<li>There was a Kasyapa Buddha, anterior to Sakyamuni. But this Maha-kasyapa was a Brahman of Magadha, who was converted by Buddha, and became one of his disciples. He took the lead after Sakyamuni’s death, convoked and directed the first synod, from which his title of Arya-sthavira is derived. As the first compiler of the Canon, he is considered the fountain of Chinese orthodoxy, and counted as the first patriarch. He also is to be reborn as Buddha. Eitel, p. 64.</li>
<li>The bhikshunis are the female monks or nuns, subject to the same rules as the bhikshus, and also to special ordinances of restraint. See Hardy’s E. M., chap. 17. See also Sacred Books of the East, vol. xx, p. 321.</li>
<li>The Sramaneras are the novices, male or female, who have vowed to observe the Shikshapada, or ten commandments. Fa-hien was himself one of them from his childhood. Having heard the Trisharana, or threefold formula of Refuge — “I take refuge in Buddha; the Law; the Church — the novice undertakes to observe the ten precepts that forbid —(1) destroying life; (2) stealing; (3) impurity; (4) lying; (5) intoxicating drinks; (6) eating after midday; (7) dancing, singing, music, and stage-plays; (8) garlands, scents, unguents, and ornaments; (9) high or broad couches; (10) receiving gold or silver.” Davids’ Manual, p. 160; Hardy’s E. M., pp. 23, 24.</li>
<li>The eldest son of Sakyamuni by Yasodhara. Converted to Buddhism, he followed his father as an attendant; and after Buddha’s death became the founder of a philosophical realistic school (vaibhashika). He is now revered as the patron saint of all novices, and is to be reborn as the eldest son of every future Buddha. Eitel, p. 101. His mother also is to be reborn as Buddha.</li>
<li>There are six (sometimes increased to ten) paramitas, “means of passing to nirvana:— Charity; morality; patience; energy; tranquil contemplation; wisdom (prajna); made up to ten by use of the proper means; science; pious vows; and force of purpose. But it is only prajna which carries men across the samsara to the shores of nirvana.” Eitel, p. 90.</li>
<li>According to Eitel (pp. 71, 72), “A famous Bodhisattva, now specially worshipped in Shan-se, whose antecedents are a hopeless jumble of history and fable. Fa-hien found him here worshipped by followers of the mahayana school; but Hsuan-chwang connects his worship with the yogachara or tantra-magic school. The mahayana school regard him as the apotheosis of perfect wisdom. His most common titles are Mahamati, “Great wisdom,” and Kumara-raja, “King of teaching, with a thousand arms and a hundred alms-bowls.”</li>
<li>Kwan-she-yin and the dogmas about him or her are as great a mystery as Manjusri. The Chinese name is a mistranslation of the Sanskrit name Avalokitesvra, “On-looking Sovereign,” or even “On-looking Self-Existent,” and means “Regarding or Looking on the sounds of the world,”=“Hearer of Prayer.” Originally, and still in Thibet, Avalokitesvara had only male attributes, but in China and Japan (Kwannon), this deity (such popularly she is) is represented as a woman, “Kwan-yin, the greatly gentle, with a thousand arms and a thousand eyes;” and has her principal seat in the island of P’oo-t’oo, on the China coast, which is a regular place of pilgrimage. To the worshippers of whom Fa-hien speaks, Kwan-she-yin would only be Avalokitesvara. How he was converted into the “goddess of mercy,” and her worship took the place which it now has in China, is a difficult inquiry, which would take much time and space, and not be brought after all, so far as I see, to a satisfactory conclusion. See Eitel’s Handbook, pp. 18-20, and his Three Lectures on Buddhism (third edition), pp. 124-131. I was talking on the subject once with an intelligent Chinese gentleman, when he remarked, “Have you not much the same thing in Europe in the worship of Mary?”</li>
<li>Compare what is said in chap. v.</li>
<li>This nirvana of Buddha must be — not his death, but his attaining to Buddhaship.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Chapter XVII</h3>
僧伽施國
Sankasya. Buddha’s Ascent to and Descent from the Trayastrimsas Heaven, and Other Legends.

從此東南行十八由延，有國名僧仂施。
From this they proceeded south-east for eighteen yojanas, and found themselves in a kingdom called Sankasya,<sup>1</sup>

佛上忉利天三月爲母說法來下處。
at the place where Buddha came down, after ascending to the Trayastrimsas heaven,<sup>2</sup> and there preaching for three months his Law for the benefit of his mother.<sup>3</sup>

佛上忉利天，以神通力，都不使諸弟子知。未滿七日，乃放神足。阿那律以天眼遙見世尊，即語尊者大目連，汝可往問訊世尊。
Buddha had gone up to this heaven by his supernatural power,<sup>4</sup> without letting his disciples know; but seven days before the completion (of the three months) he laid aside his invisibility,<sup>4</sup> and Anuruddha,<sup>5</sup> with his heavenly eyes,5 saw the World-honoured one, and immediately said to the honoured one, the great Mugalan, “Do you go and salute the World-honoured one.” 

目連即往，頭面禮足，共相問訊。
Mugalan forthwith went, and with head and face did homage at (Buddha’s) feet. They then saluted and questioned each other,

問訊已，佛語目連︰「吾卻後七日，當下閻浮提。」
and when this was over, Buddha said to Mugalan, “Seven days after this I will go down to Jambudvipa;”

目連既還，於時八國大王及諸臣民，不見佛久，咸皆渴仰，雲集此國以待世尊。
and thereupon Mugalan returned. At this time the great kings of eight countries with their ministers and people, not having seen Buddha for a long time, were all thirstily looking up for him, and had collected in clouds in this kingdom to wait for the World-honoured one.

時優鉢羅比丘尼即自心念︰「今日國王、臣民皆當迎佛，我是女人，何由得先見佛？」
Then the bhikshuni Utpala<sup>6</sup> thought in her heart, “To-day the kings, with their ministers and people, will all be meeting (and welcoming) Buddha. I am (but) a woman; how shall I succeed in being the first to see him?”<sup>7</sup> 

即以神足，化作轉輪聖王，最前禮佛。
Buddha immediately, by his spirit-like power, changed her into the appearance of a holy Chakravartti<sup>8</sup> king, and she was the foremost of all in doing reverence to him.

佛從忉利天上東向下。
As Buddha descended from his position aloft in the Trayastrimsas heaven,  

下時，化作三道寶階：佛在中道七寶階上行；
when he was coming down, there were made to appear three flights of precious steps. Buddha was on the middle flight, the steps of which were composed of the seven precious substances.

梵天王亦化作白銀階，在右邊執白拂而侍；
The king of Brahma-loka<sup>9</sup> also made a flight of silver steps appear on the right side, (where he was seen) attending with a white chowry in his hand. 

天帝釋化作紫金階，在左邊執七寶蓋而侍。
Sakra, Ruler of Devas, made (a flight of) steps of purple gold on the left side, (where he was seen) attending and holding an umbrella of the seven precious substances.

諸天無數從佛來下。
An innumerable multitude of the devas followed Buddha in his descent.

佛既下，三階俱沒於地，餘有七級而現。
When he was come down, the three flights all disappeared in the ground, excepting seven steps, which continued to be visible.

後阿育王欲知其根際，遣人掘看，下至黃泉，根猶不盡。
Afterwards king Asoka, wishing to know where their ends rested, sent men to dig and see. 

王益敬信，即於階上起精舍，當中階作丈六立像，精舍後立石柱，高二十肘，上作師子，柱內四邊有佛像，內外映徹，淨若琉璃。
They went down to the yellow springs10 without reaching the bottom of the steps, and from this the king received an increase to his reverence and faith, and built a vihara over the steps, with a standing image, sixteen cubits in height, right over the middle flight. Behind the vihara he erected a stone pillar, about fifty cubits high,11 with a lion on the top of it.12 Let into the pillar, on each of its four sides,13 there is an image of Buddha, inside and out14 shining and transparent, and pure as it were of /lapis lazuli/.

有外道論師與沙門諍此住處，時沙門理屈，於是共立誓言︰「此處若是沙門住處者，今當有靈驗。」
Some teachers of another doctrine15 once disputed with the Sramanas about (the right to) this as a place of residence, and the latter were having the worst of the argument, when they took an oath on both sides on the condition that, if the place did indeed belong to the Sramanas, there should be some marvellous attestation of it.

作是言已，柱頭師子乃大鳴吼見證，於是外道懼怖，心伏而退。
When these words had been spoken, the lion on the top gave a great roar, thus giving the proof; on which their opponents were frightened, bowed to the decision, and withdrew.

佛以受天食三月故，身作天香，不同世人。
Through Buddha having for three months partaken of the food of heaven, his body emitted a heavenly fragrance, unlike that of an ordinary man.

即便浴身，後人於此處起浴室，浴室猶在。
He went immediately and bathed; and afterwards, at the spot where he did so, a bathing-house was built, which is still existing.

優鉢羅比丘尼初禮佛處今亦起塔。
At the place where the bhikshuni Utpala was the first to do reverence to Buddha, a tope has now been built.

佛在世時，有翦髮、爪作塔，及過去三佛並釋迦文佛坐處、經行處，及作諸佛形像處，盡有塔，今悉在。
At the places where Buddha, when he was in the world, cut his hair and nails, topes are erected; and where the three Buddhas16 that preceded Sakyamuni Buddha and he himself sat; where they walked,17 and where images of their persons were made. At all these places topes were made, and are still existing.

天帝釋、梵天王從佛下處亦起塔。
At the place where Sakra, Ruler of the Devas, and the king of the Brahma-loka followed Buddha down (from the Trayastrimsas heaven) they have also raised a tope.

此處僧及尼可有千人，皆同衆食，雜大、小乘學。
At this place the monks and nuns may be a thousand, who all receive their food from the common store, and pursue their studies, some of the mahayana and some of the hinayana.

住處一白耳龍，與此衆僧作檀越，令國內豐熟，雨澤以時，無諸災害，使衆僧得安。
Where they live, there is a white-eared dragon, which acts the part of danapati to the community of these monks, causing abundant harvests in the country, and the enriching rains to come in season, without the occurrence of any calamities, so that the monks enjoy their repose and ease.

衆僧感其惠，故爲作龍舍，敷置坐處，又爲龍設福食供養。
In gratitude for its kindness, they have made for it a dragon-house, with a carpet for it to sit on, and appointed for it a diet of blessing, which they present for its nourishment.

衆僧日日衆中別差三人，到龍舍中食。
Every day they set apart three of their number to go to its house, and eat there. 

每至夏坐訖，龍輒化形作一小蛇，兩耳邊白。
Whenever the summer retreat is ended, the dragon straightway changes its form, and appears as a small snake,<sup>18</sup> with white spots at the side of its ears.

衆僧識之，銅杅盛酪，以龍置中。
As soon as the monks recognise it, they fill a copper vessel with cream, into which they put the creature, and then carry it round from the one who has the highest seat (at their tables) to him who has the lowest, when it appears as if saluting them.

從上座至下座行之，似若問訊，遍便化去，年年一出。
When it has been taken round, immediately it disappeared; and every year it thus comes forth once.

其國豐饒，人民熾盛，最樂無比。
The country is very productive, and the people are prosperous, and happy beyond comparison. 

諸國人來，無不經理，供給所須。
When people of other countries come to it, they are exceedingly attentive to them all, and supply them with what they need.

寺西北五十由延，有一寺名火境。
Fifty yojanas north-west from the monastery there is another, called “The Great Heap.”<sup>19</sup>

火境者，惡鬼名也。佛本化是惡鬼。
Great Heap was the name of a wicked demon, who was converted by Buddha, and men subsequently at this place reared a vihara.

後人於此處起精舍，以精舍布施阿羅漢，以水灌手，水瀝滴地，其處故在。
When it was being made over to an Arhat by pouring water on his hands,<sup>20</sup> some drops fell on the ground.

正復掃除，常現不滅。此處別有佛塔，善鬼神常掃灑，初不須人功。有邪見國王言︰「汝能如是者，我當多將兵衆住此，益積糞穢，汝復能除不？」鬼神即起大風，吹之令淨。此處有百枚小塔。人終日數之，不能得知。若至意欲知者，便一塔邊置一人，已復計數。人人或多或少，其不可得知。有一僧伽藍，可六七百僧。此中有辟支佛食處、泥洹地，大如車輪。餘處生草，此處獨不生。及曬衣地處，亦不生草。衣條著地跡，今故現在。

法顯在龍精舍夏坐。
罽饒夷城

坐訖，東南行七由延，到罽饒夷城。城接恆水，有二僧伽藍，盡小乘學。

去城西六七里，恆水北岸，佛爲諸弟子說法處。傳雲︰說無常、苦，說身如泡沫等。此處起塔猶在。

度恆水，南行三由延，到一村，名呵梨。佛於此中說法、經行、坐處，盡起塔。
沙祇大國

從此東南行十由延，到沙祇大國。

出沙祇城南門，道東，佛本在此嚼楊枝，刺土中，即生長七尺，不增不減。諸外道婆羅門嫉妬，或斫或拔，遠棄之，其處續生如故。此中亦有四佛經行、坐處，起塔故在。
拘薩羅國舍衛城

從此北行八由延，到拘薩羅國舍衛城。城內人民希曠，都有二百餘家。即波斯匿王所治城也。大愛道故精舍處，須達長者井壁，及鴦掘魔得道、般泥洹、燒身處，後人起塔，皆在此城中。諸外道婆羅門生嫉妬心，欲毀壞之，天即雷電霹靂，終不能得壞。

出城南門千二百步，道西，長者須達起精舍。精舍東向開門，門戶兩廂有二石柱，左柱上作輪形，右柱上作牛形。池流清淨，林木尚茂，衆華異色，蔚然可觀，即所謂祇洹精舍也。

佛上忉利天爲母說法九十日，波斯匿王思見佛，即刻牛頭栴檀作佛像，置佛坐處。佛後還入精舍，像即避出迎佛。佛言：「還坐。吾般泥洹後，可爲四部衆作法式。」像即還坐。此像最是衆像之始，後人所法者也。佛於是移住南邊小精舍，與像異處，相去二十步。祇洹精舍本有七層，諸國王、人民競興供養，懸繒幡蓋，散華，燒香，然燈續明，日日不絶。鼠銜燈炷，燒花幡蓋，遂及精舍，七重都盡。諸國王、人民皆大悲惱，謂栴檀像已燒。卻後四五日，開東小精舍戶，忽見本像，皆大歡喜。共治精舍，得作兩重，還移像本處。

法顯、道整初到祇洹精舍，念昔世尊住此二十五年，自傷生在邊地，共諸同志遊歷諸國，而或有還者，或有無常者，今日乃見佛空處，愴然心悲。彼衆僧出，問顯等言：「汝等從何國來？」答曰︰「從漢地來。」彼衆僧歎曰︰「奇哉！邊國之人乃能求法至此！」自相謂言︰「我等諸師和上相承已來，未見漢道人來到此也。」

精舍西北四里有榛，名曰得眼。本有五百盲人，依精舍住此。佛爲說法，盡還得眼。盲人歡喜，刺杖著地，頭面作禮。杖遂生長大，世人重之，無敢伐者，遂成爲榛，是故以得眼爲名。祇洹衆僧中食後，多往彼榛中坐禪。

祇洹精舍東北六七里，毗舍佉母作精舍，請佛及僧，此處故在。

祇洹精舍大援各有二門，一門東向，一門北向。此園即須達長者布金錢買地處也。精舍當中央，佛住此處最久。說法、度人、經行、坐處亦盡起塔，皆有名字。及孫陀利殺身謗佛處。

出祇洹東門，北行七十步，道西，佛昔共九十六種外道論議，國王、大臣、居士、人民皆雲集而聽。時外道女名旃柘摩那起嫉妬心，及懷衣著腹前，似若妊身，於衆會中謗佛以非法，於是天帝釋即化作白鼠，齧其腰帶斷，所懷衣墮地，地即劈裂，生入地獄。及調達毒爪欲害佛，生入地獄處。後人皆標識之。又於論議處起精舍，精舍高六丈許，裏有坐佛像。

其道東有外道天寺，名曰影覆，與論議處精舍夾道相對，亦高六丈許。所以名影覆者，日在西時，世尊精舍影則映外道天寺；日在東時，外道天寺影則北映，終不能得映佛精舍也。外道常遣人守其天寺，掃灑、燒香，燃燈供養。至明旦，其燈輒移在佛精舍中。婆羅門恚言：「諸沙門取我燈，自供養佛。」爲爾不止。婆羅門於是夜自伺候，見其所事天神持燈繞佛精舍三帀，供養佛已，忽然不見。婆羅門乃知佛神大，即捨家入道。傳雲︰近有此事。

繞祇洹精舍有九十八僧伽藍，盡有僧住處，唯一處空。

此中國有九十六種外道，皆知今世、後世，各有徒衆。亦皆乞食，但不持鉢。亦復求福，於曠路側立福德舍，屋宇、床臥、飲食，供給行路人及出家人、來去客，但所期異耳。調達亦有衆在，供養過去三佛，唯不供養釋迦文佛。

舍衛城東南四里，瑠璃王欲伐舍夷國，世尊當道側立，立處起塔。
都維、那毗伽等三邑

城西五十里，到一邑，名都維，是迦葉佛本生處。父子相見處、般泥洹處，皆悉起塔。迦葉如來全身舍利亦起大塔。

從舍衛城東南行十二由延，到一邑，名那毗伽，是拘樓秦佛所生處。父子相見處、般泥洹處，亦有僧伽藍，起塔。

從此北行，減一由延，到一邑，是拘那含牟尼佛所生處。父子相見處、般泥洹處，亦皆起塔。
迦維羅衛城

從此東行，減一由延，到迦維羅衛城。城中都無王民，甚如坵荒，只有衆僧、民戶數十家而已。白淨王故宮處，作太子母形像，及太子乘白象入母胎時。太子出城東門，見病人迴車還處。皆起塔。阿夷相太子處。與難陀等撲象、捔、射處，箭東南去三十里入地，今泉水出，後世人治作井，令行人飲之。佛得道，還見父王處。五百釋子出家，向優波離作禮，地六種震動處。佛爲諸天說法，四天王守四門，父王不得入處。佛在尼拘律樹下，東向坐，大愛道布施佛僧伽梨處，此樹猶在。瑠璃王殺釋種子，釋種子先盡得須陀洹，立塔，今亦在。城東北數里有王田，太子坐樹下觀耕者處。

城東五十里有王園，園名論民。夫人入池洗浴，出池北岸二十步，舉手攀樹枝，東向生太子。太子墮地行七步，二龍王浴太子身，浴處遂作井。及上洗浴池，今衆僧常取飲之。

凡諸佛有四處常定：一者成道處；二者轉法輪處；三者說法論議伏外道處；四者上忉利天爲母說法來下處。餘者則隨時示現焉。

迦維羅衛國大空荒，人民希疏。道路怖畏白象、師子，不可妄行。
藍莫國

從佛生處東行五由延，有國名藍莫。此國王得佛一分舍利，還歸起塔，即名藍莫塔。塔邊有池，池中有龍，常守護此塔，晝夜供養。阿育王出世，欲破八塔作八萬四千塔，破七塔已，次欲破此塔，龍便現身，持阿育王入其宮中，觀諸供養具已，語王言：「汝供若能勝是，便可壞之持去，吾不與汝爭。」阿育王知其供養具非世之有，於是便還。

此中荒蕪，無人灑掃。常有羣象以鼻取水灑地，取雜華香而供養塔。諸國有道人來，欲禮拜塔，遇象大怖，依樹自翳，見象如法供養。道人大自悲感：此中無有僧伽藍可供養此塔，乃令象灑掃。道人即捨大戒，還作沙彌，自挽草木，平治處所，使得淨潔，勸化國王作僧住處，己爲寺主。今現有僧住。此事在近。自爾相承至今，恆以沙彌爲寺主。

從此東行三由延，太子遣車匿、白馬還處，亦起塔。

從此東行四由延，到炭塔，亦有僧伽藍。
拘夷那竭城

復東行十二由延，到拘夷那竭城。城北雙樹間希連河邊，世尊於此北首而般泥洹。及須跋最後得道處，以金棺供養世尊七日處，金剛力士放金杵處，八王分舍利處。此諸處皆起塔，有僧伽藍，今悉現在。

其城中人民亦希曠，止有衆僧民戶。
諸梨車欲逐佛般泥洹處

從此東南行十二由延，到諸梨車欲逐佛般泥洹處。而佛不聽，戀佛不肯去。佛化作大深壍，不得渡。佛與鉢作信遣還。其家處立石柱，上有銘題。
毗舍離國

自此東行十由延，到毗舍離國。毗舍離城北，大林重閣精舍，佛住處，及阿難半身塔。其城裏本菴婆羅女家，爲佛起塔，今故現在。城南三里，道西，菴婆羅女以園施佛，作佛住處。佛將般泥洹，與諸弟子出毗舍離城西門，迴身右轉，顧看毗舍離城，告諸弟子：「是吾最後所行處。」後人於此處起塔。

城西北三里，有塔，名放弓仗。以名此者，恆水上流有一國王，王小夫人生一肉胎，大夫人妬之，言：「汝生不祥之徵。」即盛以木函，擲恆水中。下流有國王遊觀，見水上木函，開看，見千小兒，端正殊特，王即取養之。遂便長大，甚勇健，所往征伐，無不摧伏。次伐父王本國，王大愁憂。小夫人問王：「何故愁憂？」王曰︰「彼國王有千子，勇健無比，欲來伐吾國，是以愁耳。」小夫人言︰「王勿愁憂！但於城東作高樓，賊來時，置我樓上，則我能卻之。」王如其言。至賊來時，小夫人於樓上語賊言：「汝是我子，何故作反逆事？」賊曰：「汝是何人，雲是我母？」小夫人曰︰「汝等若不信者，盡仰向張口。」小夫人即以兩手構兩乳，乳各作五百道，墮千子口中。賊知是其母，即放弓仗。二父王於是思惟，皆得辟支佛。二辟支佛塔猶在。後世尊成道，告諸弟子：「是吾昔時放弓仗處。」後人得知，於此立塔，故以名焉。千小兒者，即賢劫千佛是也。佛於放弓仗塔邊告阿難言：「我卻後三月，當般泥洹。」魔王嬈固阿難，使不得請佛住世。

從此東行三四里，有塔。佛般泥洹後百年，有毗舍離比丘錯行戒律，十事證言佛說如是。爾時諸羅漢及持律比丘凡有七百僧，更檢校律藏。後人於此處起塔，今亦現在。
五河合口

從此東行四由延，到五河合口。阿難從摩竭國向毗舍離，欲般泥洹，諸天告阿闍世王，阿闍世王即自嚴駕，將士衆追到河上。毗舍離諸梨車聞阿難來，亦復來迎，俱到河上。阿難思惟：「前則阿闍世王致恨，還則梨車復怨。」則於河中央入火光三昧，燒身而般泥洹，分身作二分，一分在一岸邊。於是二王各得半身舍利，還歸起塔。
摩竭提國巴連弗邑

度河南下一由延，到摩竭提國巴連弗邑。巴連弗邑是阿育王所治。城中王宮殿皆使鬼神作，累石墻闕，雕文刻鏤，非世所造。今故現在。

阿育王弟得羅漢道，常住耆闍崛山，志樂閑靜。王敬心欲請家供養。以樂山靜，不肯受請。王語弟言：「但受我請，當爲汝於城裏作山。」王乃具飲食，召諸鬼神而告之曰：「明日悉受我請，無座席，各自賷來。」明日諸大鬼神各持大石來，辟方四五步，坐訖，即使鬼神累作大石山。又於山底以五大方石作一石室，可長三丈，廣二丈，高丈餘。

有一大乘婆羅門子，名羅沃私婆迷，住此城裏，爽悟多智，事無不達，以清淨自居。國王宗敬師事，若往問訊，不敢並坐。王設以愛敬心執手，執手已，婆羅門輒自灌洗。年可五十餘，舉國瞻仰。賴此一人，弘宣佛法，外道不能得加陵衆僧。

於阿育王塔邊，造摩訶衍僧伽藍，甚嚴麗。亦有小乘寺，都合六七百僧衆。威儀庠序可觀。四方高德沙門及學問人，欲求義理，皆詣此寺。婆羅門子師亦名文殊師利，國內大德沙門、諸大乘比丘，皆宗仰焉，亦住此僧伽藍。

凡諸中國，唯此國城邑爲大。民人富盛，競行仁義。年年常以建卯月八日行像。作四輪車，縛竹作五層，有承櫨、揠戟，高二疋許，其狀如塔。以白㲲纏上，然後彩畫，作諸天形像。以金、銀、琉璃莊校其上，懸繒幡蓋。四邊作龕，皆有坐佛，菩薩立侍。可有二十車，車車莊嚴各異。當此日，境內道俗皆集，作倡伎樂，華香供養。婆羅門子來請佛，佛次第入城，入城內再宿。通夜然燈，伎樂供養。國國皆爾。其國長者、居士各於城內立福德醫藥舍，凡國中貧窮、孤獨、殘跛、一切病人，皆詣此舍，種種供給。毉師看病隨宜，飲食及湯藥皆令得安，差者自去。

阿育王壞七塔，作八萬四千塔。最初所作大塔在城南三里餘。此塔前有佛腳跡，起精舍，戶北向塔。塔南有一石柱，圍丈四、五高，三丈餘。上有銘題，雲︰「阿育王以閻浮提布施四方僧，還以錢贖，如是三反。」

塔北三四百步，阿育王本於此作泥梨城。中央有石柱，亦高三丈餘，上有師子。柱上有銘，記作泥梨城因緣及年數、日月。
小孤石山　那羅聚落

從此東南行九由延，至一小孤石山。山頭有石室，石室南向。佛坐其中，天帝釋將天樂般遮彈琴樂佛處。帝釋以四十二事問佛，佛一一以指畫石，畫跡故在。此中亦有僧伽藍。

從此西南行一由延，到那羅聚落，是舍利弗本生村。舍利弗還於此村中般泥洹。即此處起塔，今亦現在。
王舍新城　䓑沙王舊城

從此西行一由延，到王舍新城。新城者，是阿闍世王所造，中有二僧伽藍。出城西門三百步，阿闍世王得佛一分舍利起塔，高大嚴麗。

出城南四里，南向入谷，至五山裏。五山周圍，狀若城郭，即是䓑沙王舊城。城東西可五六里，南北七八里。舍利弗、目連初見頞鞞處，尼犍子作火坑、毒飯請佛處，阿闍世王酒飲黑象欲害佛處，城東北角曲中，耆舊於菴婆羅園中起精舍請佛及千二百五十弟子供養處，今故在。其城中空荒，無人住。

入谷，搏山東南上十五里，到耆闍崛山。未至頭三里，有石窟南向，佛本於此坐禪。西北三十步，復有一石窟，阿難於中坐禪，天魔波旬化作雕鷲，住窟前恐阿難，佛以神足力隔石舒手摩阿難肩，怖即得止。鳥跡、手孔今悉在，故曰雕鷲窟山。窟前有四佛坐處。又諸羅漢各各有石窟坐禪處，動有數百。佛在石室前，東西經行。調達於山北嶮巇間橫擲石傷佛足指處，石猶在。佛說法堂已毀壞，止有塼壁基在。其山峯秀端嚴，是五山中最高。

法顯於新城中買香、華、油、燈，倩二舊比丘送法顯上耆闍崛山。華、香供養，然燈續明。慨然悲傷，收淚而言︰「佛昔於此住，說《首楞嚴》。法顯生不值佛，但見遺跡處所而已。」既於石窟前誦《首楞嚴》。停止一宿，還向新城。

出舊城北行三百餘步，道西，迦蘭陀竹園精舍今現在，衆僧掃灑。精舍北二三里有屍摩賒那。屍摩賒那者，漢言棄死人墓田。搏南山西行三百步，有一石室，名賓波羅窟，佛食後常於此坐禪。又西行五六里，山北陰中有一石室，名車帝。佛泥洹後，五百阿羅漢結集經處。出經時，鋪三空座，莊嚴校餝，舍利弗在左，目連在右。五百數中少一阿羅漢。大迦葉爲上座。時阿難在門外不得入。其處起塔，今亦在。搏山亦有諸羅漢坐禪石窟甚多。

出舊城北，東下三里，有調達石窟。離此五十步，有大方黑石。昔有比丘在上經行，思惟是身無常、苦、空，得不淨觀，猒患是身，即捉刀欲自殺。復念世尊制戒，不得自殺。又念雖爾，我今但欲殺三毒賊。便以刀自刎。始傷，再得須陀洹，既半得阿那含，斷已成阿羅漢果，般泥洹。
伽耶城　貝多樹下

從此西行四由延，到伽耶城，城內亦空荒。

復南行二十里，到菩薩本苦行六年處，處有林木。從此西行三里，到佛入水洗浴，天按樹枝得攀出池處。又北行二里，得彌家女奉佛乳糜處。從此北行二里，佛於一大樹下石上，東向坐食糜，樹、石今悉在，石可廣、長六尺，高二尺許。中國寒暑均調，樹木或數千歲，乃至萬歲。

從此東北行半由延，到一石窟。菩薩入中，西向結加趺坐，心念：「若我成道，當有神驗。」石壁上即有佛影現，長三尺許，今猶明亮。時天地大動，諸天在空中白言：「此非是過去、當來諸佛成道處，去此西南行，減半由延，到貝多樹下，是過去、當來諸佛成道處。」諸天說是語已，即便在前唱導，導引而去。菩薩起行。離樹三十步，天授吉祥草，菩薩受之。復行十五步，五百青雀飛來，繞菩薩三帀而去。

菩薩前到貝多樹下，敷吉祥草，東向而坐。時魔王遣三玉女從北來試，魔王自從南來試，菩薩以足指按地，魔兵退散，三女變老。自上苦行六年處，及此諸處，後人皆於中起塔立像，今皆在。佛成道已，七日觀樹受解脫樂處。佛於貝多樹下東西經行七日處。諸天化作七寶臺供養佛七日處。文鱗盲龍七日繞佛處。佛於尼拘律樹下方石上東向坐，梵天來請佛處。四天王奉鉢處。五百賈人授麨蜜處。度迦葉兄弟師徒千人處。此諸處亦起塔。佛得道處有三僧伽藍，皆有僧住。衆僧民戶供給饒足，無所乏少。戒律嚴峻，威儀、坐起、入衆之法，佛在世時聖衆所行，以至於今。

佛泥洹已來，四大塔處相承不絶。四大塔者：佛生處，得道處，轉法輪處，般泥洹處。

阿育王昔作小兒時，當道戲。過迦葉佛行乞食，小兒歡喜，即以一掬土施佛。佛持還，泥經行地。因此果報，作鐵輪王，王閻浮提。乘鐵輪案行閻浮提，見鐵圍兩山間地獄治罪人。即問羣臣：「此是何等？」答言︰「是鬼王閻羅王治罪人。」王自念言︰「鬼王尚能作地獄治罪人，我是人主，何不作地獄治罪人耶？」即問臣等：「誰能爲我作地獄主治罪人者？」臣答言︰「唯有極惡人能作耳。」王即遣臣遍求惡人。見池水邊有一人，長壯、黑色、髮黃、目青，以腳鉤魚，口呼禽獸，禽獸來便射殺，無得脫者。得此人已，將來與王。王密勑之：「汝作四方高墻，內殖種種華果，作好浴池，莊嚴校餝，令人渴仰。牢作門戶，有人入者輒捉，種種治罪，莫使得出。設使我入，亦治罪莫放。今拜汝作地獄王。」有比丘。次第乞食入其門。獄卒見之，便欲治罪。比丘惶怖，求請須臾，聽我中食。俄頃，復有人入，獄卒內置碓臼中擣之，赤沫出。比丘見已，思惟此身無常、苦、空，如泡如沫，即得阿羅漢。既而獄卒捉內鑊湯中，比丘心顏欣悅，火滅，湯冷，中生蓮華，比丘坐上。獄卒即往白王，獄中奇怪，願王往看。王言：「我前有要，今不敢往。」獄卒言︰「此非小事，王宜疾往。」更改先要，王即隨入。比丘爲說法，王得信解，即壞地獄，悔前所作衆惡。由是信重三寶，常至貝多樹下，悔過自責，受八齋。王夫人問：「王常遊何處？」羣臣答言︰「恆在貝多樹下。」夫人伺王不在時，遣人伐其樹倒。王來見之，迷悶躃地。諸臣以水灑面，良久乃蘇。王即以塼累四邊，以百甖牛乳灌樹根。身四布地，作是誓言：「若樹不生，我終不起。」誓已，樹便即根上而生，以至於今。高減十丈。
雞足山

從此南三里行，到一山，名雞足。大迦葉今在此山中。劈山下入，入處不容人，下入極遠有旁孔，迦葉全身在此中住。孔外有迦葉本洗手土，彼方人若頭痛者，以此土塗之即差。此山中即日故有諸羅漢住，彼方諸國道人年年往供養迦葉，心濃至者，夜即有羅漢來，共言論，釋其疑已，忽然不現。此山榛木茂盛，又多師子、虎、狼，不可妄行。
曠野

法顯還向巴連弗邑。順恆水西下十由延得一精舍，名曠野，佛所住處。今現有僧。
迦屍國波羅㮏城

復順恆水西行十二由延，到迦屍國波羅㮏城。城東北十里許，得仙人鹿野苑精舍。此苑本有辟支佛住，常有野鹿棲宿。世尊將成道，諸天於空中唱言：「白淨王子出家學道，卻後七日當成佛。」辟支佛聞已，即取泥洹，故名此處爲仙人鹿野苑。世尊成道已後，人於此處起精舍。佛欲度拘驎等五人，五人相謂言：「此瞿曇沙門本六年苦行，日食一麻、一米，尚不得道，況入人間，恣身、口、意，何道之有！今日來者，慎勿與語。」佛到，五人皆起作禮處。復北行六十步，佛於此東向坐，始轉法輪度拘驎等五人處。其北二十步，佛爲彌勒授記處。其南五十步，翳羅鉢龍問佛：「我何時得免此龍身？」此處皆起塔，見在。中有二僧伽藍，悉有僧住。
拘睒彌國

自鹿野苑精舍西北行十三由延，有國，名拘睒彌。其精舍名瞿師羅園，佛昔住處。今故有衆僧，多小乘學。從是東行八由延，佛本於此度惡鬼處。亦常在此住，經行、坐處皆起塔。亦有僧伽藍，可百餘僧。
達嚫國

從此南行二百由延，有國名達嚫。是過去迦葉佛僧伽藍，穿大石山作之，凡有五重：最下重作象形，有五百間石室；第二層作師子形，有四百間；第三層作馬形，有三百間；第四層作牛形，有二百間；第五層作鴿形，有百間。最上有泉水，循石室前繞房而流，周圍迴曲，如是乃至下重，順房流，從戶而出。諸層室中處處穿石，作䆫牖通明。室中朗然，都無幽暗。其室四角頭穿石作梯蹬上處。今人形小，緣梯上，正得至昔人一腳躡處。因名此寺爲波羅越，波羅越者，天竺名鴿也。其寺中常有羅漢住。此土丘荒，無人民居。去山極遠方有村。皆是邪見，不識佛法、沙門、婆羅門及諸異學。彼國人民常見人飛來入此寺。於時諸國道人慾來禮此寺者，彼村人則言：「汝何以不飛耶？我見此間道人皆飛。」道人方便答言：「翅未成耳。」

達嚫國幽嶮，道路艱難，而知處。欲往者，要當賷錢貨施彼國王，王然後遣人送，展轉相付，示其逕路。法顯竟不得往，承彼土人言，故說之耳。
還巴連弗邑寫律

從波羅㮏國東行，還到巴連弗邑。法顯本求戒律，而北天竺諸國皆師師口傳，無本可寫，是以遠涉，乃至中天竺。於此摩訶衍僧伽藍得一部律，是《摩訶僧祇衆律》，佛在世時最初大衆所行也，於祇洹精舍傳其本。自餘十八部各有師資，大歸不異，然小小不同，或用開塞。但此最是廣說備悉者。復得一部抄律，可七千偈，是《薩婆多衆律》，即此秦地衆僧所行者也。亦皆師師口相傳授，不書之於文字。復於此衆中得《雜阿毗曇心》，可六千偈。又得一部《綖經》，二千五百偈。又得一卷《方等般泥洹經》，可五千偈。又得《摩訶僧祇阿毗曇》。故法顯住此三年，學梵書、梵語，寫律。

道整既到中國，見沙門法則，衆僧威儀，觸事可觀，乃追歎秦土邊地，衆僧戒律殘缺。誓言︰「自今已去至得佛，願不生邊地。」故遂停不歸。

法顯本心欲令戒律流通漢地，於是獨還。
瞻波大國

順恆水東下十八由延，其南岸有瞻波大國。佛精舍、經行處及四佛坐處，悉起塔。現有僧住。
多摩梨帝國

從此東行近五十由延，到多摩梨帝國，即是海口。其國有二十四僧伽藍，盡有僧住，佛法亦興。法顯住此二年，寫經及畫像。
師子國記遊
師子國概述

於是載商人大舶，汎海西南行，得冬初信風，晝夜十四日，到師子國。彼國人云，相去可七百由延。

其國本在洲上，東西五十由延，南北三十由延。左右小洲乃有百數，其間相去或十里、二十里，或二百里，皆統屬大洲。

多出珍寶珠璣。有出摩尼珠地，方可十里。王使人守護，若有採者，十分取三。

其國本無人民，正有鬼神及龍居之。諸國商人共市易，市易時鬼神不自現身，但出寶物，題其價直，商人則依價置直取物。因商人來、往、住故，諸國人聞其土樂，悉亦復來，於是遂成大國。

其國和適，無冬夏之異，草木常茂，田種隨人，無有時節。
大塔

佛至其國，欲化惡龍。以神足力，一足躡王城北，一足躡山頂，兩跡相去十五由延。於王城北跡上起大塔，高四十丈，金銀莊校，衆寶合成。
無畏山僧伽藍

塔邊復起一僧伽藍，名無畏山，有五千僧。起一佛殿，金銀刻鏤，悉以衆寶。中有一青玉像，高二丈許，通身七寶炎光，威相嚴顯，非言所載。右掌中有一無價寶珠。法顯去漢地積年，所與交接悉異域人，山川草木，舉目無舊，又同行分披，或流或亡，顧影唯己，心常懷悲。忽於此玉像邊見商人以晉地一白絹扇供養，不覺淒然，淚下滿目。
貝多樹

其國前王遣使中國，取貝多樹子，於佛殿旁種之。高可二十丈，其樹東南傾，王恐倒，故以八九圍柱拄樹。樹當拄處心生，遂穿柱而下，入地成根。大可四圍許，柱雖中裂，猶裹其外，人亦不去。樹下起精舍，中有坐像，道俗敬仰無倦。
王城及佛齒供養

城中又起佛齒精舍，皆七寶作。王淨修梵行，城內人敬信之情亦篤。其國立治已來，無有饑喪荒亂。衆僧庫藏多有珍寶、無價摩尼，其王入僧庫遊觀，見摩尼珠，即生貪心，欲奪取之。三日乃悟，即詣僧中，稽首悔前罪心。因白僧言，願僧立制，自今已後，勿聽王入庫看，比丘滿四十臈，然後得入。

其城中多居士、長者、薩薄商人。屋宇嚴麗，巷陌平整。四衢道頭皆作說法堂，月八日、十四日、十五日，鋪施高座，道俗四衆皆集聽法。其國人云，都可六萬僧，悉有衆食，王別於城內供養五六千人衆食，須者則持大鉢往取，隨器所容，皆滿而還。

佛齒常以三月中出之。未出十日，王莊校大象，使一辯說人，著王衣服，騎象上，擊皷唱言：「菩薩從三阿僧祇劫，作行不惜身命，以國、妻、子及挑眼與人，割肉貿鴿，截頭布施，投身餓虎，不恡髓腦，如是種種苦行，爲衆生故。成佛在世四十五年，說法教化，令不安者安，不度者度，衆生緣盡，乃般泥洹。泥洹已來一千四百九十七年，世間眼滅，衆生長悲。卻後十日，佛齒當出至無畏山精舍。國內道俗欲殖福者，各各平治道路，嚴餝巷陌，辨衆華香，供養之具！」如是唱已，王便夾道兩邊，作菩薩五百身已來種種變現，或作須大拏，或作睒變，或作象王，或作鹿、馬。如是形像，皆彩畫莊校，狀若生人。然後佛齒乃出，中道而行，隨路供養，到無畏精舍佛堂上。道俗雲集，燒香、然燈，種種法事，晝夜不息。滿九十日乃還城內精舍。城內精舍至齋日則開門戶，禮敬如法。
跋提精舍

無畏精舍東四十里，有一山。山中有精舍，名跋提，可有二千僧。僧中有一大德沙門，名達摩瞿諦，其國人民皆共宗仰。住一石室中四十許年，常行，慈心，能感蛇鼠，使同止一室而不相害。
摩訶毗訶羅精舍

城南七里有一精舍，名摩訶毗可羅，有三千僧住。

有一高德沙門，戒行清潔，國人咸疑是羅漢。臨終之時，王來省視，依法集僧而問：「比丘得道耶？」其便以實答言：「是羅漢。」既終，王即案經律，以羅漢法葬之。於精舍東四、五里，積好大薪，縱廣可三丈餘，高亦爾，近上著栴檀、沉水諸香木，四邊作階上，持淨好白㲲周帀蒙積上。作大輿床，似此間𨎪車，但無龍魚耳。當闍維時，王及國人、四衆咸集，以華香供養。從轝至墓所，王自華香供養。供養訖，轝著𧂐上，以酥油遍灌，然後燒之。火然之時，人人敬心，各脫上服，及羽儀、傘蓋，遙擲火中，以助闍維。闍維已，收斂取骨，即以起塔。法顯至，不及其生存，唯見葬時。

王篤信佛法，欲爲衆僧作新精舍。先設大會，飯食僧。供養已，乃選好上牛一雙，金銀、寶物莊校角上。作好金犁，王自耕頃田邊，然後割給民戶、田宅，書以鐵券。自是已後，代代相承，無敢廢易。
天竺道人誦經

法顯在此國，聞天竺道人於高座上誦經，雲︰「佛鉢本在毗舍離，今在揵陁衛。竟若干百年，法顯聞誦之時有定歲數，但今忘耳。當復至西月氏國。若干百年，當至於闐國。住若干百年，當至屈茨國若干百年，當復來到漢地。住若干百年，當復至師子國。若干百年，當還中天竺。到天竺已，當上兜術天上。彌勒菩薩見而嘆曰︰『釋迦文佛鉢至。』即共諸天華香供養七日。七日已，還閻浮提，海龍王持入龍宮。至彌勒將成道時，鉢還分爲四，復本頻那山上。彌勒成道已，四天王，當復應念佛如先佛法。賢劫千佛共用此鉢。鉢去已，佛法漸滅。佛法滅後，人壽轉短，乃至五歲。五歲之時，粳米、酥油皆悉化滅，人民極惡，捉木則變成刀、杖，共相傷割。其中有福者，逃避入山，惡人相殺盡已，還復來出，共相謂言：『昔人壽極長，但爲惡甚，作諸非法故，我等壽命遂爾短促，乃至五歲。我今共行諸善，起慈悲心，修行信義。』如是各行信義，展轉壽倍，乃至八萬歲。彌勒出世，初轉法輪時，先度釋迦遺法弟子、出家人及受三歸、五戒、齋法，供養三寶者，第二、第三次度有緣者。」法顯爾時欲寫此經，其人云︰「此無經本，我止口誦耳。」
更得經本

法顯住此國二年，更求得《彌沙塞律》藏本，得《長阿含》、《雜阿含》，復得一部《雜藏》。此悉漢土所無者。
浮海東還
自師子國到耶婆提國

得此梵本已，即載商人大船，上可有二百餘人。後係一小船，海行艱嶮，以備大船毀壞。得好信風，東下二日，便值大風。船漏水入。商人慾趣小船，小船上人恐人來多，即斫緪斷，商人大怖，命在須臾，恐船水滿，即取麁財貨擲著水中。法顯亦以君墀及澡罐並餘物棄擲海中，但恐商人擲去經像，唯一心念觀世音及歸命漢地衆僧：「我遠行求法，願威神歸流，得到所止。」如是大風晝夜十三日，到一島邊。潮退之後，見船漏處，即補塞之。於是復前。

海中多有抄賊，遇輒無全。大海彌漫無邊，不識東西，唯望日、月、星宿而進。若陰雨時，爲逐風去，亦無准。當夜闇時，但見大浪相搏，晃若火色，黿、鱉水性怪異之屬，商人荒遽，不知那向。海深無底，又無下石住處。至天晴已，乃知東西，還復望正而進。若值伏石，則無活路。

如是九十日許，乃到一國，名耶婆提。
自耶婆提歸長廣郡界

其國外道、婆羅門興盛，佛法不足言。

停此國五月日，復隨他商人大船，上亦二百許人，賷五十日糧，以四月十六日發。法顯於船上安居。東北行，趣廣州。

一月餘日，夜皷二時，遇黑風暴雨。商人、賈客皆悉惶怖，法顯爾時亦一心念觀世音及漢地衆僧。蒙威神祐，得至天曉。曉已，諸婆羅門議言：「坐載此沙門，使我不利，遭此大苦。當下比丘置海島邊。不可爲一人令我等危嶮。」法顯本檀越言︰「汝若下此比丘，亦並下我！不爾，便當殺我！汝其下此沙門，吾到漢地，當向國王言汝也。漢地王亦敬信佛法，重比丘僧。」諸商人躊躇，不敢便下。

於時天多連陰，海師相望僻誤，遂經七十餘日。糧食、水漿欲盡，取海鹹水作食。分好水，人可得二升，遂便欲盡。商人議言：「常行時正可五十日便到廣州，爾今已過期多日，將無僻耶？」即便西北行求岸，晝夜十二日，到長廣郡界牢山南岸，便得好水、菜。但經涉險難，憂懼積日，忽得至此岸，見蔾藿依然，知是漢地。
南下向都

然不見人民及行跡，未知是何許。或言未至廣州，或言已過，莫知所定。即乘小船，入浦覓人，欲問其處。得兩獵人，即將歸，令法顯譯語問之。法顯先安慰之，徐問︰「汝是何人？」答言︰「我是佛弟子。」又問︰「汝入山何所求？」其便詭言︰「明當七月十五日，欲取桃臘佛。」又問︰「此是何國？」答言︰「此青州長廣郡界，統屬晉家。」聞已，商人歡喜，即乞其財物，遣人往長廣。

太守李嶷敬信佛法，聞有沙門持經像乘船汎海而至，即將人從至海邊，迎接經像，歸至郡治。商人於是還向楊州。劉沇青州請法顯一冬、一夏。夏坐訖，法顯離諸師久，欲趣長安。但所營事重，遂便南下向都，就禪師出經律。
結語

法顯發長安，六年到中國，停六年，還三年達青州。凡所遊歷，減三十國。沙河已西，迄於天竺，衆僧威儀法化之美，不可詳說。竊惟諸師來得備聞，是以不顧微命，浮海而還，艱難具更，幸蒙三尊威靈，危而得濟，故將竹帛疏所經歷，欲令賢者同其聞見。是歲甲寅。
跋

晉義熙十二年，歲在壽星，夏安居末，慧遠迎法顯道人。既至，留共冬齋。因講集之餘，重問遊歷。其人恭順，言輒依實。由是先所略者，勸令詳載。顯復具敘始末。自雲︰「顧尋所經，不覺心動汗流。所以乘危履嶮，不惜此形者，蓋是志有所存，專其愚直，故投命於不必全之地，以達萬一之冀。」於是感歎斯人，以爲古今罕有。自大教東流，未有忘身求法如顯之比。然後知誠之所感，無窮否而不通；志之所將，無功業而不成。成夫功業者，豈不由忘失所重，重夫所忘者哉！
