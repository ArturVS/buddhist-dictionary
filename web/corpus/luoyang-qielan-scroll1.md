### Summary
This scroll contains the two passages below.

景樂寺… 有佛殿一所。像輦在焉。雕刻巧妙。冠絕一時。

The Ching-lo Nunnery (Nunnery of the Happy View) … There was a Hall of Buddha that housed a carriage for the sacred image. The deftness shown in carving it had no parallel at the time.

昭儀尼寺 …寺有一佛二菩薩。塑工精絕。京師所無也。四月七日。常出詣景明。景明三像恒出迎之。伎樂之盛與劉騰相比。

The Chao-i Nunnery (Nunnery of the Exemplar) The nunnery housed statues of one Buddha and two bodhisattvas, splendid sculpture not matched elsewhere in the capital. On the seventh day of the fourth month, [the three statues] were always carried to the Ching-ming Monastery (Bright Prospect Monastery) where they were habitually met by three others housed there. [On that occasion] the display of rich music and shows was comparable to that of Liu Teng’s [Ch'ang-ch'iu Temple].

### Notes:
The British style transliterations from Wang have been converted to Pinyin elsewhere. So Lo-Yang becomes Luoyang, Ching-lo Nunnery becomes Jingle Nunnery, and Chao-i Nunnery becomes Zhaoyi Nunnery.
