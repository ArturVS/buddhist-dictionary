A passage in this scroll mentioned salt production in Qingzhou 青州, in present-day Shandong:

Adjustment exceptions were frequently made to make purchases in places where ripe grain was abundant. Woven silk was used to buy grain, which was used to fill the state stores. In all provinces, the shore areas, rivers, crossings, and ferry transporation in addition to storage of grains in official granaries is administered by the Shipping Bureau. In the four provinces of Cangzhou, Yingzhou [Hejian], Youzhou [Beijing], and Qingzhou, salt produced at the official facilities from evaporation of sea water, which generated revenue to support military personnel and infrastructure.From that time on the granaries were filled amply. Even though there were severe droughts in some areas leading to bad harvests, on each occasion the state granaries were used to offset the problem.
常調之外，逐豐稔之處，折絹糴粟，以充國儲。於諸州緣河津濟，皆官倉貯積，以擬漕運。於滄、瀛、幽、青四州之境，傍海置鹽官，以煮鹽，每歲收錢，軍國之資，得以周贍。自是之後，倉廩充實，雖有水旱兇饑之處，皆仰開倉以振之。
