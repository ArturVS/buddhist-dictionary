Unconditioned merits surpass all 無為福勝分

Text 原文本

「須菩提！如恆河中所有沙數，如是沙等恆河， 於意云何？是諸恆河沙寧為多不？」　須菩提言： 「甚多，世尊！但諸恆河尚多無數，何況其沙。」 「須菩提！我今實言告汝。若有善男子、善女人， 以七寶滿爾所恆河沙數三千大千世界， 以用布施，得福多不？」須菩提言：「甚多，世尊！」 佛告須菩提：「若善男子、善女人，於此經中， 乃至受持四句偈等，為他人說， 而此福德勝前福德。

“Subhūti, suppose each sand grain in the Ganges [gaṅgā] River [mahānada], contained its own Ganges River [gaṅgā]. What do you think, would there be many grains of sand of the Ganges River?” Subhūti said, “There would be extremely many, Bhagavān. The number of Ganges Rivers [gaṅgā] alone would be countless, let alone their grains of sand.” “Subhūti, I will now tell you a truth. If a good man or good woman filled such a number of three thousand great thousand-worlds with the Seven Precious Jewels in the practice of giving [dāna], would he or she obtain many merits [puṇya]?” Subhūti said, “Extremely many, Bhagavān.”

The Sanskrit name for the Ganges is gaṅgā (Chinese 恆河). The Sanskrit word for great river is mahānada (Chinese 河). It has very fine, silt-like sand. So the amount of sand grains is an incredibly large number.

The Buddha told Subhūti, “Just so, if good men [kulaputra] and good women [kuladuhitā] accept and maintain even a four-line gāthā from within this sūtra, speaking it to others, then the merits [puṇya] of this surpass the former merits [puṇya].

In his commentary on the Diamond Sūtra Hsing Yun writes

The Diamond Sūtra teaches us that by giving without notions, we can be granted limitless merit. It also states that the gift of Dharma is superior to material gifts. It is easy to give material things once one's needs have been met, but making it possible for living beings to develop their own wisdom from within is not something that can be done by relying upon money and material goods alone.
