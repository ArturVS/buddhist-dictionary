### English translation
The likes of the Buddha’s Birthday great assembly, Enlightenment Day great assembly, Turning the Dharma Wheel great assembly, Rāhula great assembly, Ānanda great assembly, pañca-vārṣika great assembly, or overnight dharma lectures should be held outdoors. In case of wind, rain, snow, or cold, one should go indoors and sit upright. For those elderly or sick and unable to sit, a partition should be set up. The partition must not be made of loose materials, and should be as high as the area of the shoulder and armpit.

(Chapman 2007, p277)
