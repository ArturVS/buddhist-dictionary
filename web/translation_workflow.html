      <h2>Translation and Document Analysis Workflows</h2>
      <p>
        This page describes the ways that the web site can be used in 
        different translation workflows. Besides translations, document analysis
        also includes 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Reading a document, historic or modern, and using the web site to 
          understand more about certain words or phrases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Getting a sense of an untranslated historic document. Full translation
          may not be feasible for but you want to get an overall sense of 
          the content and nature of the document.
        </li>
        <li>
          Commentary or annotations in a modern language, say for research 
          of a historic Chinese document. The output of the research may be a paper 
          in modern Chinese or English. Additional notes may be create about 
          the meanings of the words, the identity of certain people or places, 
          or notes about difficult phrases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Translation memory. That is, once a new translation term or phrase has been
          discovered the user wants to record it so that it can be easily
          identified next time it is encountered.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reuse material found on the web site.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3><a name="casual"></a>Casual use for a private translation</h3>
      <p>
        In this workflow a user does not join the GitHub project but simply
        wants to use the web site as tool for a private translation. The user has
        their own private copy of the document and does not wish to share it.
        The user wants to use the site to search word meanings and for translation
        memory.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Phrases or words are cut-and-paste from the private Word document into the
          word or phrase search page to find the word meanings.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a word is found that is not in the dictionary then the user can open a
          <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/issues">GitHub issue</a> 
          describing the word to add.
          The content will periodically be incorporated into the dictionary by a 
          project member and the web site refreshed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user can copy material from the web site under the terms of the 
          <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative 
          Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License</a> license.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3><a name="sense"></a>Use to get the sense of a historic Chinese document</h3>
      <p>
        In this workflow the user does not have a deep knowledge of Chinese but wants
        to get the overall sense of a document. The user is not a project member.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the document is short then phrases are cut-and-paste from the private 
          Word document into the word or phrase search page to find the tabulated list of 
          word meanings.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the document is long the user downloads the project from 
          <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary"></a> and uses the 
          command line tools to analyze the text. Please note that the command line tools
          are not complete yet.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3><a name="contributor"></a>Project team member for a publicly available translation</h3>
      <p>
        In this workflow a user <a href="faq.html#join">joins the GitHub project</a>, uses the web site 
        as tool for translation, and contributes the content back to the project.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A new corpus document will be created. The orginal text will be saved as a
          plain text document and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">mark down</a> 
          document will be created to save links to words and commments about the 
          content of the source document.
        </li>
        <li>
          Phrases or words are cut-and-paste from the source document into the
          word search to find the word meanings. As new words and additional
          information about existings words are discovered the project member 
          adds these directly to the text-based data files.
        </li>
        <li>
          The GitHub content will periodically be incorporated into the web site by the
          project member resulting in a the web site refresh.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Asked Questions</a> page.
