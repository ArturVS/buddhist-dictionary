      <h2>Translation and Document Analysis Workflows</h2>
      <p>
        This page describes the ways that the web site can be used in 
        different translation workflows. Besides translations document analysis
        includes 
      <ol>
        <li>
          Reading a document, historic or modern, and using the web site to 
          understand more about certain words or phrases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Getting a sense of an untranslated historic document. Full translation
          may not be feasible for but you want to get an overall sense of 
          the content and nature of the document.
        </li>
        <li>
          Commentary or annotations in a modern language, say for commentary 
          in modern Chinese or English of a historic Chinese document. Additional
          notes may be about the meanings of the words, the identity of certain
          people or places, or notes about difficult phrases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Translation memory. Tat is, once a new translation term or phrase has been
          discovered the user wants to record it so that it can be easily
          identified next time it is encountered.
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h3><a name="casual">Casual use for a private translation</a></h3>
      <p>
        In this workflow the user does not join the dictionary GitHub project but simply
        wants to use the web site as tool for a private translation. The user has
        their own private copy of the document and does not wish to share it.
        The user wants to use the site to search word meanings and for translation
        memory.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Phrases or words are cut-and-paste from the private Word document into the
          word search to find the word meanings.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a word is found that is not in the dictionary then the user can open a
          
        </li>
        <li>
          
        </li>
      </ol>
