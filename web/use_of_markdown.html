      <h2>Use of Markdown, Corpus Management, and Part-of-Speech Tagging</h2>
      <h3>Use of markdown and corpus management</h2>
      <p>
        See the Buddhist Dictionary GitHub project
        <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/tree/master/web/corpus">corpus directory</a> 
        for a list of markdown files used in the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> can allow people who are not 
        software or web design specialists to easily work with plain text that can be transformed
        to HTML later. Markdown consists of simple and intuitive patterns, such has headers and 
        bullet lists for making plan text more readable.  This makes it easy to add annotations to
        primary source documents or copies of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The collection of primary texts and markdown documents is through a corpus schema, including 
        start and end markers for primary text. Adaptations for easy display of primary source text 
        from common repositories of primary sources, particulary CBETA. For details on the corpus schema see the 
        <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/blob/master/data/dictionary/corpus-readme.txt">corpus-readme.txt</a>
        document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Markdown viewers and parsers widely available, so it is a good medium for transfering 
        text between systems. In particular, users of the web site can use the markdown generated on 
        the web site, copying that elsewere to to another site. The 
        <a href="about.html">terms and conditions</a> of the the web site allow direct copying, with 
        attribution.
      <h2>Part-of-Speech Tagging</h2>
      <p>
        This is a new effort. I am following the part-of-speech (PoS) Tagging format documented by UPenn 
        for the UPen Chinese Treebank project. However, that was designed for modern Chinese and this
        project is mainly in literary Chinese, which has a different grammar. Still, the UPenn format 
        is used as the best choice at the moment.
