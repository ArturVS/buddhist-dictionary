      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p>
        The Fo Guang Shan Nan Tian Institute Chinese-Sanskrit-English Buddhist Dictionary
        and language toolkit (佛光山南天大學中梵英詞典與語言分析工具) is a non-profit, open source 
        project for use in reading and analyzing Chinese and Sanskrit Buddhist texts.
      </p>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        The goals the dictionary are
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create an online dictionary that is easy to use for everybody interested in Buddhism, 
          including lay people reading Buddhist texts, students, translators, and academics.
          If you are looking at a large chunk of Chinese or Sanskrit text but not sure what it means
          then this is for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create electronic tools that are useful for lingustic analysis of Buddhist texts, 
          including identification of specialist Buddhist terms and comparison of 
          Chinese and Sanskrit texts.
          If your goal is to translate the Mahayana Buddhist Canon, then this website and 
          GitHub project is especially for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Share the source code and content with the general public. If you want to reuse source
          code or contribute source code or data then the 
          <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary">GitHub project</a> is built for you.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        What the dictionary is not includes: an encyclopedia or a glossary of Buddhist terms.
        Sorry, but there are people better qualified than me to create this. Please see the 
        <a href="dict_resources.html">Resources</a> section for some excellent resources.
        The project started out as a generic Chinese dictionary and is OK for that.
        Most of the terms in the dictionary are actually not Buddhist terms.
        I hope that people that used the dictionary before I specialized it to Buddhism keep
        using it.
