            Question: Is this a glossary?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: No. The dictionary is not an encyclopedia or a glossary of Buddhist terms.
            Please see the <a href="references.html">References</a> page for some excellent 
            source of English and Chinese explanations of Buddhist terms.

            Question: Is this a Chinese-English dictionary?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: Yes. The project started out as a generic Chinese dictionary and works OK for that.
            Most of the terms in the dictionary are actually not Buddhist terms.
            I hope that people that used the dictionary before I specialized it to Buddhism keep
            using it. A full Chinese dictionary is retained to assist in analyzing blocks of Chinese
            text without the reader having to switch between a regular Chinese dictionary and a
            Buddhist Chinese dictionary.

            Question: Can I copy stuff out of the dictionary?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: Yes, if you attribute the source appropriately. You should attribute the
            source of the data to the NTI Chinese-Sanskrit-English Buddhist Dictionary under the
            terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative

          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: Please do. To join the project send an email with your 
            <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> id and a note introducting yourself to 
            alex@chinesenotes.com.

            Question: Can I just add one word to the dictionary without actually joining the project?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: Please create a 
            <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/issues">GitHub issue</a> describing 
            the word to add. Please include the Chinese and English text of the word, the grammar or type 
            of word you are adding and any other notes about it. Names of places, people, and institutions
            are fine too. Here is an example of a ticket to add an entry to the dictionary:
            <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/issues/1">Example ticket to add a 
            dictionary entry</a>.
            You can also create tickets to add a character, synonym, or to correct an entry.

            Question: What is a dictionary entry?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: Primary dictionary entries can be a word, a freqently occurring phrase, or the name
            person, place, or organization, with a mapping to another languages. The mappings supported
            today are Chinese to English and Sanskrit to Chinese with English. Because of the search 
            capabilities the dictionary can be searched in reverse order and for complete phrases as well.

            3 443 Character entries, 2 900 Buddhist word entries, 1 145 Sanskrit-Chinese word entries,
