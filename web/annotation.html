      <h2>Text Management, Annotation, and Gloss</h2>
      <p>
        This page gives some background on the data and 
        <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/tree/master/command-line"
        title="Command line tool on GitHub">bdictutil.py</a> command line tool that was used
        to generate the data that drives this web site.
      </p>
      <h3>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The collection of texts in this web site are managed as a <i>text corpus</i>.
        A text corpus, or simply <i>corpus</i>, is a term used in linguistics to 
        mean a representative collection of texts used to 
        study the linguistic characteristics of a language. 
        The Brown Corpus, first published in 1961 [Francis 1964], was the first large corpus developed.
        It consists of about 1 million English words.
      </p>
      <p>
        An <i>annotated corpus</i> or <i>treebank</i> adds information about the structure 
        of the text, particularly part of speech and semantic information.  The Penn Treebank Project 
        [Penn Treebank Project] was the first large-scale treebank developed.
        The NTI Chinese-Sanskrit-English Buddhist Dictionary is just beginning to include
        parsed text in the form of a phrase dataset.
        The use of a phrase dataset consisting of short phrases can be used in a very 
        practical way in the Buddhist texts because:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Most Buddhist literature is written in Literary Chinese, starting in the first
            century CE to the present day and remains untranslated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Phrases in the text are repeated frequently. For example, the phrase 於意云何
            &lt;what do you think?&gt; is repeated 30 times in the Diamond Sutra, which contains
            a total of only 4615 words.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Chinese language has a long history during which words have acquired many meanings
            resulting in a great deal of ambiguity when looking up words in the dictionary.
            The context of the word is needed to determine word sense and the simplest way to 
            to determine context is to check if the word is used in a similar phrase with 
            a known translation.
          <li>
            Short phrases can be easily matched into untranslated sentences.
          </li>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Each corpus entry includes meta data about a primary source document, such as
        the source and links to plain text versions, English translations, vocabulary
        analysis, and other information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Gloss</i> is a form of annotation that explains the meanings of words in texts.
        A collection of glosses is called a <i>glossary</i>.
        A historic example is Biblical gloss that was used to annotate the meanings of
        words in the Bible. Biblical gloss was usually added in margins and included
        commentaries as well. <i>Interlinear gloss</i> is gloss added between the lines.
        Historic annotations are valuable in themselves and may
        give explainations of the source text that would not be known otherwise.
        However, they have often been ommitted when documents were new versions of 
        documents were published, retaining the original text only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gloss is also used in a modern context by linguists to help them study and 
        discuss languages that they cannot understand themselves. Typically, this 
        kind of gloss in added after the native terms in square brackets, such as
        佛 [Buddha]. Besides the meaning of foreign words in English, linguists also
        sometimes indicate pronunciation with gloss.
        The Penn Chinese Treebank has a particular style of gloss used
        that includes gloss for indivual words in square brackets and angle brackets
        for the phrase as a whole [Nianwen 2005]. For example, 乘 [riding] 白 [white] 
        象 [elephant] &lt;riding a white elephant&gt;.
        This web site follows that style 
        in the phrase memory dataset, putting in mouse-over for the convenience
        of readers.
        You can see the Penn Treebank format gloss used in the phrase detail pages on
        this web site. For example, 
        <a href="http://localhost/buddhistdict/phrase_detail.php?id=21"
        title="To to this web page to see an example of a phrase detail with annotation">乘白象</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Use of markdown and corpus management</h3>
      <p>
        Each corpus entry has a text file that uses a markdown file. Markdown is a plain
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> can allow people who are not 
        software or web design specialists to easily work with plain text that can be transformed
        to HTML later. Markdown consists of simple and intuitive patterns, such has headers and 
        bullet lists for making plan text more readable.  This makes it easy to add annotations to
        primary source documents or copies of them.
        See the Buddhist Dictionary GitHub project
        <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/tree/master/web/corpus">corpus directory</a> 
        for a list of markdown files used in the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The collection of primary texts and markdown documents is through a corpus schema, including 
        start and end markers for primary text. Adaptations for easy display of primary source text 
        from common repositories of primary sources, particulary CBETA. For details on the corpus schema see the 
        <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/blob/master/data/dictionary/corpus-readme.txt">corpus-readme.txt</a>
        document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Markdown viewers and parsers widely available, so it is a good medium for transfering 
        text between systems. In particular, users of the web site can use the markdown generated on 
        the web site, copying that elsewere to to another site. The 
        <a href="about.html">terms and conditions</a> of the the web site allow direct copying, with 
        attribution.
      <h3>Part-of-Speech Tagging</h3>
      <p>
        This is a new effort. At the moment, part-of-speech (PoS) tagging is only used in the phrase 
        dataset. Initially, only commonly occuring phrases identified through ngram scanning will be
        tagged.
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows the PoS tagging format documented by the Penn Chinese Treebank project. 
        That was designed for modern Chinese but this
        project is mainly in literary Chinese, which has a different grammar. Still, the Penn format 
        is used as the best choice at the moment. See the 
        <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~chinese/">Penn Chinese Treebank</a> web site for more
        details.
        See the <a href="pos_tags.html">Part-of-Speech Tag Definitions</a> for a list of the tags used in
        this project.
