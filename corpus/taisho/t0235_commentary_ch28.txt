<h3>Not receiving, not desiring 不受不貪分</h3>
<h4>Text</h4>

<div class="text">「須菩提！ 若菩薩以滿恆河沙等世界七寶布施； 若復有人知一切法無我，得成於忍， 此菩薩勝前菩薩所得功德。須菩提！以諸菩薩不受福德故。」 須菩提白佛言：「世尊！云何菩薩不受福德？」 「須菩提！菩薩所作福德，不應貪著， 是故說不受福德。

Yifa: “Subhuti, if a bodhisattva filled as many trichiliocosms as there are grains of sand [vālukā] in the Ganges River [gaṅgānadī] with the seven treasures [saptaratnaparipūrṇa] and used them to practice giving [dāna], and if, however, there is someone who knows all dharmas are selfless, achieving forbearance [kṣānti], this bodhisattva surpasses the merit [puṇya] obtained by the aforementioned bodhisattva.”

“Subhuti, this is because all bodhisattvas do not receive rewards [puṇya].”

Subhuti addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One, why do you say bodhisattvas do not receive rewards?”

“Subhuti, the rewards bodhisattvas earn should not be desired. For this reason it is said they do not receive rewards.”

<h4>Comments</h4>

The English word endurance translates the Chinese 忍, Sanskrit kṣānti. This could be better translated as tolerance or forbearance. It is the third of the six paramitas. The English word acquire translates the Chinese 得, Sanskrit parigraha.

In the Issattha Sutta King Pasenadi of Kosala asked the Blessed One

<div class="commentary">Blessed One: "Where, lord, should a gift be given?"

"Wherever the mind feels confidence, great king."

"But a gift given where, lord, bears great fruit?"

"This [question] is one thing, great king — 'Where should a gift be given?' — while this — 'A gift given where bears great fruit?' — is something else entirely. What is given to a virtuous person — rather than to an unvirtuous one — bears great fruit.
(SN 3.24<sup>1</sup>)

This chapter resolves the reason for the Buddha saying previously that no merit was obtained: he says that so that bodhisattvas would not attach to it.

The statement “... someone who knows all dharmas are selfless, achieving forbearance ...” seems to relate forbearance as a result of knows all dharmas are selfless. It seems like an odd conclusion because knowing that all dharmas are selfless may lead to many other results as well. The Chinese text is very consistent with this translation: 有人知一切法無我，得成於忍. Red Pine's explains “... by realizing and accepting that all dharmas have no self, that they are not real, a bodhisattva gives up attachment to all things ...”
