NTI Buddhist Text Reader Project
===============================================================================

The NTI Buddhist Text Reader is a digital library for Chinese Buddhist texts
with a built-in text reader, a Chinese-English dictionary and corpus management
tools, for analyzing and managing Buddhist Chinese texts. This is a non-profit,
open source project. Subscribe to the group
[ntireader-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ntireader-announce),
a low volume group for announcements, to keep up to date.

Goals:

1. Create a text reader for the Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō version of the 
   Chinese Buddhist canon.

2. Create a Chinese-English Buddhist dictionary that is free and easy to use for 
   everybody interested in Buddhism, including lay people reading Buddhist
   texts, students, translators, and academics.

3. Create tools that are useful for lingustic analysis of Buddhist texts,
   including identification of specialist Buddhist terms and comparison of
   Chinese texts.

There are three parts to the project:

1. The web user interface. This includes HTML and JavaScript files. 
   The HTML files are generated by the Go language 
   [cnreader](https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com/tree/master/go/src/cnreader)
   command line tool from the [Chinese Notes](http://chinesenotes.com) sister
   project. The dynamic content is driven by a Go web application.

2. The data. This is the dictionary and text files. The data files are in UTF-8
   tab delimited text. There is also a corpus directory, which contains the
   literature to build the vocabulary and word frequency from. These are
   Chinese texts from the Buddhist canon and related collections.

3. Jupyter notebooks and other Python tools for building vocabulary.
