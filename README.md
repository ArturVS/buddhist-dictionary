NTI Chinese-English Dictionary and Buddhist Text Project

A Chinese-English dictionary and tools for analyzing and managing Buddhist texts.

This is a non-profit, open source project for use in reading and analyzing 
Chinese and Sanskrit Buddhist texts.

Goals:

1. Create a dictionary that is easy to use for everybody interested in Buddhism, 
   including lay people reading Buddhist texts, students, translators, and academics.

2. Create tools that are useful for lingustic analysis of Buddhist texts, including 
   identification of specialist Buddhist terms and comparison of Chinese and
   Sanskrit texts.

3. Share the source code and content with the general public.

There are three parts to the project:

1. The web user interface. This includes HTML, PHP, and JavaScript files.

2. The data. This is the dictionary and text files. The data files are in UTF-8 tab
   delimited text. There is also a corpus directory, which contains the literature
   to build the vocabulary and word sense frequency from. These are Chinese and 
   Sanksrit texts from the Buddhist canon and related collections. The corpus 
   files include part-of-speech (POS) tagged documents.

3. Command line tools. For building vocabulary. These are in Python. This include
   a POS tagger.
