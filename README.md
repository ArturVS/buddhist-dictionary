===================

A Chinese-Sanskrit-English Buddhist Dictionary and linguistic tools.

This is a non-profit, open source project operated by Nan Tien Institute for use in reading and analyzing Chinese
and Sanskrit Buddhist texts.

Goals:
1. Create a dictionary that is easy to use for everybody interested in Buddhism, 
   including lay people reading Buddhist texts, students, translators, and academics.
2. Create tools that are useful for lingustic analysis of Buddhist texts, including 
   identification of specialist Buddhist terms and comparison of Chinese and Sanskrit texts.
3. Share the source code and content with the general public.

There are three parts to the project:
1. The web user interface. This includes HTML, PHP, and JavaScript files.
2. The data. This is the dictionary and related files. They are in UTF-8 tab delimited text.
   There is also a corpus directory, which contains the literature to build the vocabulary
   from. These are Chinese and Sanksrit texts from the Buddhist canon and related 
   collections. The corpus documents are the source of the vocabulary.
3. Command line tools. For building vocabulary. These are in Python.
