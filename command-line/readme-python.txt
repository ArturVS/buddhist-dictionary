Python Readme
===============================================================================

The Python utilities here were created using Python 2.7. I have not tried them 
with Python 3.x.

create_vocab.py is the command to do word frequency analysis.

The modules in the bdict package use the config.yaml file to minize the parameters
passed in on the command line and to help support unit testing.

The Python utilities in the util directory load dictionary and corpus data and 
use the Jinja templates to write out HTML pages.

Jinja is needed for generating the HTML files.  See http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/intro/
for details on installation of jinja.
