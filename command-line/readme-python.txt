Python Readme
===============================================================================

The Python utilities here were created using Python 2.7. I have not tried them 
with Python 3.x.

The Python utilities load dictionary and corpus data and use the Jinja templates 
to write out HTML pages.

Jinja is needed for generating the HTML files.  See http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/intro/
for details on installation of jinja.
