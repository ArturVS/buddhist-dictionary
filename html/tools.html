<h2>Development of the NTI Reader Dictionary</h2>
<p>
  This page describes the design, sources, and building of the NTI Reader
  Dictionary. The NTI Reader Dictionary is a Chinese-English dicionary
  combining general modern Chinese, literary Chinese vocabulary, and
  Buddhist terminology.

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>
  The goals of the NTI Reader dictionary are to:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Support the NTI Reader by providing word entries for words in the texts
      in a way that is helpful to human users
    </li>
    <li>
      Building an index to help users find the most relevant texts for any given
      word
    </li>
    <li>
      Support corpus management and analysis software as a machine readable
      dictionary
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide a general resource to NTI Reader website users in general word
      search
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>
<p>
  In order to achieve these goals, the NTI Reader dictionary combines the
  function of several traditional dictionaries. In particular, it combines the
  function of a general literary Chinese-English dictionary and a Buddhist
  dictionary. Major sources for the NTI Reader dictionary are listed in the 
  table below.

        Giles’ <i>Chinese-English Dictionary</i> is one of the most
        comprehensive literary Chinese to English dictionaries available
        although it uses archaic English equivalents. It was written before
        vernacular Chinese became commonly used for Chinese text, which began
        around 1911 (Sun 2006, loc. 335-345).

  Buddhist dictionaries have some aspects of multi-lingual dictionaries because
  they often include Chinese, Sanskrit, Pali and English. For example, the
  <i>Princeton Buddhist Dictionary</i> entry for ‘dharma’ includes Sanskrit,
  Pali, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Tibetan (Buswell and Lopez 2014, s.v.
  ‘dharma’).
</p>
<p>
  Entries were added the dictionary either as they were encountered in reading
  Buddhist texts, provided by external contributors, or from terminology
  extraction, as described in <a href='word_freq.html'>Introduction to Corpus
  Analysis of the Chinese Buddhist Canon</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The NTI Reader dictionary is based on several sources that allow direct
  incorporation and extensive curation with reference to many sources. The 
  sources that allow direct incorporation include: 1. The <a
  href="http://cc-cedict.org/wiki/">CC-CEDICT Project</a> based on a <a
  href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative 
  Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License</a> (CCASE 3.0). 2. The <a
  href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/"> Unihan database</a> based on the
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html">Unicode® Terms of Use</a>. 
  3. Fo Guang Shan Terminology, used with permission (Fo Guang Shan, 2015). 
  4. Lancaster for text titles, used with permission (Lancaster, 2004). This 
  has allowed relatively rapid compilation of a Chinese-English dictionary.
</p>
<h3 id="microstructure">Microstructure</h3>
<p>
  Each dictionary entry is represented as a headword with a list of lexical
  units. A headword is generally understood as the word that a dictionary entry
  is organized around, which is often lemmatized to a basic grammatical form
  (Atkins and Rundell 2008, loc. 1353-1366). For the NTI Reader dictionary this
  is the Chinese text of the word. A lexical unit is a unit of vocabulary that
  is approximately the same as a word sense and may differ from other lexical
  units in part of speech and pronunciation (Crystal 2008, s.v. ‘lexis’). The
  English field of a single lexical unit may include several alternate
  translations called equivalents (Svensén 2009, p. 7). The project will
  describe the structure of the dictionary in detail, relating it to current
  lexicographical practice, for example, as described by Atkins and Rundell
  (2008) and Svensén, (2009).
</p>
<p>
  The basic unit of information in the NTI Reader dictionary is a lexical unit.
  See the <a
  href="buddhist_style_guide.html">Style Guide</a> for a description of semantic
  data from the perspective of an editor adding entries.
  The fields for each lexical unit are listed in the table below.

<p>
  One challenge has been assigning parts of speech to lexical entries. The
  traditional parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) are commonly
  understood but have problems in themselves and problems in application to
  literary Chinese. One of the problems with traditional parts of speech is in
  overlapping categories. Culicover gives the example ‘glass window’ where the
  noun ‘glass’ modifies the noun ‘window’  (Culicover 2009, p. 45). The noun
  ‘glass’ is acting like an adjective in this phrase. Culicover gives more
  examples of nouns acting as adjectives, including ‘cotton dress,’ ‘career
  move’ and ‘desk chair.’ The theory of syntactic categories is one attempt to
  address this problem Culicover 2009, p. 45). Despite the problem of
  overlapping categories traditional parts of speech are still commonly
  included in dictionary entries.
</p>
<p>
  Assigning parts of speech to literary Chinese is more problematic than
  English. Norman notes that lack of word morphology and freedom of movement
  between word categories are problems in formal word class analysis in literary
  Chinese (Norman 1988, p. 87). However, it is not true that words in literary
  Chinese cannot be assigned a part of speech at all. Norman outlines a system
  of word classes similar to the word classes adopted in the NTI Reader (Norman
  1988, p. 88-94).
</p>
<h3 id="metadata">Metadata</h3>
<p>
  The concept, domain, and subdomain fields are semantic labels that
  are used to tag dictionary entries.
  They help to define the kind of a word and context of its use. 
  As an example of category consider a word for a temple.
  The category of the word would be '寺院 Temple' and other
  metadata should describe the location of the temple. 
  This is what Harpring defines as an instance relationship (Harpring, 2010,
  pp. 39-40). The domain for most
  Buddhist words is '佛教 Buddhism'. Metadata can help users
  of the NTI Reader help by remove ambiguity when discussing data and can also
  help to locate related concepts and keywords. 
</p>
<p>
  The domain and subdomain fields are hierarchically related to each other and
  analogous to the Broader Terms (BT) and Narrower Terms (NT) fields in the
  <i>Library of Congress Subject Headings</i> (Library of Congress 2016, ix). 
  For example, the domain '佛教 Buddhism' is a parent of the subdomain
  'Chinese Buddhism 中国佛教' for the dictionary entry for 大乘起信論 
  <i>Treatise on the Awakening of Faith in the Mahāyāna</i>. 
</p>
<p>
  The domain values are restricted to the 
  set in <a
  href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/blob/master/data/dictionary/topics.txt"
  >topics.txt</a>. In this sense the domain labels form a controlled vocabulary.
  The possible of values for concept and subdomain are not restricted to a
  limited set.
</p>
<p>
  Burdick, et. al. write, “The use of structured and/or tagged approaches to
  identify persons, themes, places, or features of a text provides a way to
  maximize the intellectual investigation of documents and to display these
  interpretations” (Burdick, et. al. 2012, p. 35). Metadata may conform to
  formal ontologies, such as the International Committee for Documentation
  (CIDOC) Reference Model (Crofts et al. 2011), in order to use consistent
  terminology within and across information systems. The <i>Getty Art &amp; 
  Architecture Thesaurus</i> (AAT) uses such an ontology (Getty Research
  Institute).
</p>
<p>
  Ontological metadata hierarchies may be shallow or deep. The AAT uses a deep
  hierarchy. The AAT uses a
  deep taxonomy to classify concepts used in its descriptions of physical and
  digital assets. An example of this is the concept ‘buddhapadas’ (Buddha
  footprints), (Getty Research Institute, ID  ‘300395464’, viewed 29
  January 2017):
</p>
<p>
  <pre>

  .... Visual and Verbal Communication (hierarchy name) (G)
  ........ Visual Works (hierarchy name) (G)
  ................ &lt;visual works by material or technique&gt; (G)
  .................... sculpture (visual works) (G)
  ........................ &lt;sculpture by subject type&gt; (G)
  ............................ Buddhapadas (G)
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
  One concern with deep hierarchies like this is the time needed for curation.
  The NTI Reader uses a simpler hierarchy but one with no formal ontology. The
  main goals of the dictionary metadata in the NTI Reader is to (1) reduce
  lexical ambiguity and (2) facilitate curation. The data being described in the
  case of the NTI Reader dictionary is the dictionary vocabulary. The subject
  domain that the word belongs to. For example, the domain for the word entry
  海淀 Hǎidiàn ‘Haidian’ is “地方 Dìfāng ‘Places’”. The most important use of the
  domain is to distinguish modern Chinese from literary Chinese. Words that
  are used on in literary Chinese are labelled as ‘古文 Classical Chinese’.
  Other words are modern Chinese. The Subdomain field narrows the domain. For
  example, one subdomain for the domain “佛教 Fójiào ‘Buddhism’” is “大乘佛教
  Dàshèng Fójiào ‘Mahāyāna Buddhism’”.
</p>
<p>
  The domain and subdomain fields are similar to the <em>Broader Terms</em> (BT)
  and <em>Narrower Terms</em> (NT) in the <i>Library of Congress Subject
  Headings</i> (Library of Congress 2016, ix).
</p>
<p>
  Harpring defines a <em>controlled vocabulary</em> as “an information tool that
  contains standardized words and phrases used to refer to ideas, physical
  characteristics, people, places, events, subject matter, and many other
  concepts” (Harpring 2010, p. 1). Controlled vocabularies help in data
  categorization, indexing and retrieval. The concept, domain, and subdomain
  fields in the NTI Reader dictionary are more structured than simple labels
  but not as carefully defined as a controlled vocabulary. They are a controlled
  vocabulary in the sense that the concept, domain, and subdomain fields have
  some hierarchical structure. However, the system does not collect variants and
  synonyms and related those back to an authoritative record, as in a controlled
  vocabulary (Harpring 2010, p. 12). In addition, there is inconsistency in the
  hierarchy. For example, the domain value ‘Buddhism’ can be understood as a
  domain but the domain value ‘Classical Chinese’ is a language and there is no
  corresponding ‘Modern Chinese’ value in the hierarchy.
</p>
<h3 id="examples">Usage Examples</h3>
<p>
  One of the ways of assisting users with deciding on word sense is to give
  examples that illustrate the various senses. Many of the problems with
  polysemy come from commonly used words that are not specifically Buddhist
  terms. Drawing examples for these words randomly from the corpus, however,
  may not be a great idea. Finding good examples that do not confuse the user
  is a special topic in itself. The reasons are: (1) examples for non-Buddhist
  terms should not be drawn from a Buddhist source but rather from a
  representative source and (2) it is typically hard to find examples in the
  corpus that do not require specialist knowledge of the particular text to
  understand or refer to previous sections of the text. Good examples are self
  contained and simple.
