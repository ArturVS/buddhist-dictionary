      <h2>Word Frequency Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        See the <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary">Buddhist Dictionary GitHub project</a> 
        for a description on how to do word frequency analysis on Buddhist texts in Chinese and Sanskrit using
        the createvocab.py Python command line tool. Word frequencies are also used for word disambiguation by 
        the reader. The word frequencies for the tagged corpus are shown below.

      <h3>Uses of word frequency analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Word frequency analysis is useful in getting an idea of an untranslated text.
        This is important because there is more untranslated text than translated text
        in the Chinese Mahayana Tripitaka and other Chinese text collections.  
        Even for translated texts a word frequency
        analysis can be useful for writing a commentary or doing a close reading.
        It can also be useful for comparing different translations for style and quality or
        for comparing different historic recensions of the same source document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Study texts in a quantitative way rather than qualitative, covering a broader 
        range of texts than is possible than reading every text yourself.
      </p>
      <h3>Types of word frequency analysis</h3>
      <p>
        A frequency distribution of non-functional words can give an idea of the content 
        of a text at a quick glance. A frequency distribution of functional words can 
        give an idea of the style of a translator, the histoic period written, and the 
        translation source (e.g.,Sanskrit). A frequency distribution of proper nouns 
        (not implemented yet) can give an idea of the principal actors in a text.
        A character frequency distribution may be more useful when your are missing 
        vocabulary.
      </p>
      <h3>Difficulties with word frequency analysis</h3>
      <p>
        You need a good base vocabulary to do a word frequency analysis in Chinese.
        Since Chinese text does not have spaces in between words you need the vocabulary
        to find the boundaries between the words. Otherwise, you will simply end of with
        a character frequency distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sanskrit word morphology is a challenge since there is a large number of different
        inflections of Sanskrit words. It is useful to both list the different
        forms of common words in the dictionary and to do transformations for common
        inflictions. There is an infinite number of compounds that can be formed in
        Sanskrit. This provides an additional challenge. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Synonyms and Chinese character variants are an additional obstacle. The Buddha
        has ten titles, such as Tathāgata, Bhagavān. It would be useful to group these
        together.
