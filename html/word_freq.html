      <h2>Introduction to Corpus Analysis of the Chinese Buddhist Canon</h2>
      <p>
        This page explains some of the linguistic details of the corpus analysis
        of the Chinese Buddhist Canon included in the NTI Reader. The page
        may be useful to people wanting to do terminology extraction of those
        with an interest in computational linguistics. The page <a 
        href='annotation.html'>Description of the NTI Reader</a> gives more
        details on the elements and construction of the NTI Reader.
      </p>
      <h3>The NTI Reader Corpus</h3>
      <p>
        The NTI Reader is built on text in volumes 1-55 of the <a
        href='taisho/taisho.html'>Taishō shinshū daizōkyō</a> 《大正新脩大藏經》
        (Taishō) version of the Chinese Buddhist canon as a monolingual historic
        corpus. This is in contrast with a bilingual parallel corpus that
        matches two languages together in that the entire body of the corpus
        is literary Chinese. However, the metadata describing the corpus is in
        English to help users navigate the collection of texts.
      </p>
      <p>
        As explained in the page <a href='annotation.html'>Description of the
        NTI Reader</a> the <a
        href="https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com/tree/master/go/src/cnreader"
        title="Command line tool on GitHub">cnreader</a> tool analyzes the 
        Taishō version of the Chinese Buddhist canon. In
        addition to generating text files for the text reader, the program
        analyses the collection of texts as a corpus to find word frequencies,
        bigram frequencies, collocations, and extract example uses for words 
        in the NTI Reader dictionary. The analysis results for the entire
        set of texts is shown in the page 
        <a href='analysis/corpus_analysis.html'>Corpus Analysis</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Source texts are marked with genre to allow analysis to be broken by
        genre. Example genres are āgama, jātaka, and prajñāpāramitā. The most
        interesting aspect of this is to allow identification of keywords for
        specific genres. The genres are taken from the section titles of the
        Taishō.
      </p>
      <h3>Word Frequency analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Word frequency analysis is useful in getting an idea of an untranslated text.
        This is important because there is more untranslated text than translated text
        in the Chinese Buddhist canon and other Chinese text collections.  
        Even for translated texts a word frequency
        analysis can be useful for writing a commentary or doing a close reading.
        It can also be useful for comparing different translations for style and quality or
        for comparing different historic recensions of the same source document.
      </p>
      <p>
        A frequency distribution of non-functional words can give an idea of the content 
        of a text at a quick glance. A frequency distribution of functional words can 
        give an idea of the style of a translator, the histoic period written, and the 
        translation source (e.g.,Sanskrit). A frequency distribution of proper nouns 
        (not implemented yet) can give an idea of the principal actors in a text.
        A character frequency distribution may be more useful when your are missing 
        vocabulary.
      </p>
      <p>
        You need a good base vocabulary to do a word frequency analysis in Chinese.
        Since Chinese text does not have spaces in between words you need the vocabulary
        to find the boundaries between the words. Otherwise, you will simply end of with
        a character frequency distribution. The NTI Reader dictionary is 
        essential for the word frequency analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        A word frequency analysis by genre is also done. This uses genre labels
        for texts according to their position in the Taishō. For example,
        Āgama for volumes 1-2, Jātaka and Avadāna for volumes 3-4, and
        Prajñāpāramitā for volumes 5-8.
      </p>
      <h3>Content Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Word frequency analysis is also done for each individual text. Analysis
        of individual texts it is referred to <em>content analysis</em> rather
        than corpus analysis, which refers to the entire set of texts.
        For example, see the content analysis results for the 
        <a href='analysis/taisho/t1666_analysis.html'>Treatise on the Awakening
        of Faith in the Mahāyāna</a> (T 1666).
      </p>
      <h3>Word Usage Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to an overall analysis of whole corpus and each text within
        it, the analysis results can be view for each word. This includes the
        texts that the word is mentioned most frequently in, collocations, and
        examples of word usage. The list of texts that the word is mentioned
        most frequently in provides links to specific locations within the 
        Buddhist text that use the given word most frequently.
        For example, looking at the page for the word 真如 zhēnrú tathatā or 
        'suchness' we find that the term is most frequently mentioned in 
        Scroll 16 of the the Large Sūtra on Perfection of Wisdom (T 220).
      </p>
      <h4>Collocation Analysis</h4>
      <p>
        A <em>collocation</em> is a habitual combination of words
        (Crystal 2008, s.v. 'collocation'). For example, in English, an
        <i>auspicious occasion</i> or <i>draw a conclusion</i>.
        Some collocations express sentiment. For example, the collocations
        a <i>notorious thief</i> and <i>habitual gambler</i> express negative
        sentiments. This is related to the concept of <i>semantic prosody</i>,
        which describes words that occur together with other words in a 
        semantic set (Crystal 2008, s.v. 'semantic prosody').
        Collocations are important in translation and will usually be 
        translation units.
      </p>
      <p>
        List of collocations in the NTI Reader are based on a bigram analysis
        of the corpus. To avoid the list being dominated by common bigrams that
        are related to free selection with function words, bigrams with 
        function words are removed from the set.
      </p>
      <h3>Vocabulary Identification</h3>
      <p>
        Corpus analysis has also be used to identify words and word senses
        subsequently added to the NTI Reader dictionary. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The scan of the texts by the cnreader
        software identifies all the Chinese characters that are not in the
        dictionary. Word entries for these characters are then added using
        the Jupyter notebook <a
        href='https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com/blob/master/python/unihan.ipynb'
        >unihan.ipynb</a> from the entry in the Unihan database
        (Unicode Consortium 2016, 'Unihan Database Lookup').
      </p>
      <p>
        Titles for texts in the Taishō were extracted from 
        <a href='http://cbeta.org/'>CBETA</a>, which is shared under Creative
        Commons, and the The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalogue
        (Lancaster, 2004), which was used with permission. This was automated
        using the <a 
        href='https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com/blob/master/python/add_title.ipynb'
        >add_title.ipynb</a> Jupyter notebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other words were found in reading Buddhist texts or examining the 
        bigram frequency list and then added the dictionary after
        checking the defintions in one or more of the <a href='references.html'
        >References</a>.
