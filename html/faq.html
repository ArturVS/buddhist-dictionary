            Question: Is this a Chinese-English dictionary?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: Yes. The project started out as a generic Chinese-English
            dictionary and works OK for general use. A full Chinese-English
            dictionary is used to assist in analyzing corpora of Chinese
            Buddhist texts without the reader having to switch between a
            literary Chinese-English dictionary and a Buddhist Chinese dictionary.

          <p>
            Answer: Yes, if you attribute the source appropriately. You should
            attribute the source of the data to the NTI Buddhist Text Reader
            under the terms of the <a

            Question: What is a dictionary entry?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: Headwords dictionary entries can be a word, a freqently
            occurring phrase, or the name person, place, or organization, with a
            mapping to another languages. The mappings supported today are
            Chinese to English and Sanskrit to Chinese with English. Because of
            the search capabilities the dictionary can be searched in reverse
            order and for complete phrases as well. The body of dictionary
            entries includes a list of word senses and how the word is used in
            the texts forming the corpus.

            Question: Is this a research project?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: The NTI Reader is more of a sequence of experiments than a
            coherent research project. The project has evolved through personal
            study, use in volunteer translation at Fo Guang Shan, and academic
            study.

            Question: How big is the dictionary?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: As of June 2017 the dictionary has 64,188 lexical units
            with 51,399 headwords. Of those 9,701 are Buddhist terms. As noted
            in the Terminology Extraction section of the <a
            href="/word_freq.html#extraction"> Introduction to Corpus Analysis
            of the Chinese Buddhist Canon</a> there are at least 10,000 Buddhist
            terms mentioned in Ding Fubao's 《丁福保佛學大辭典》 <i>Dictionary of
            Buddhist Studies</i> that are found in the Taishō but are not in the
            NTI Reader. Translating these terms and adding them as headwords to
            the NTI Reader is a major current focus of work.

            Question: What are the current issues and problems with the NTI
            Reader?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: There are a number of issues listed in the Github repository
            <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/issues"
            >issues folder</a>. One fairly major issue is that Siddhaṃ
            characters and images cannot be displayed in the NTI Reader. This
            is discussed in detail in issue 5 <a
            href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/issues/5"
            >Special Text, Image Elements and Nonstandard Layouts</a>.
