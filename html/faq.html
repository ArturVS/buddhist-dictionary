            Question: May I ask the sources of translations in NTI reader?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: I arrive at the English equivalents myself by comparing as
            many sources as I can find or translating directly if there are only
            Chinese sources. You can find the link at the bottom of the pages.
            The list of references for Buddhist entries used is at
            <a href="https://ntireader.org/references.html">References</a>.
            Note that some sources allow direct copying, including those out
            of copyright due to age and those shared under a 
            <a href="https://creativecommons.org/"></a> Creative Commons</p>
            license.

            The NTI Reader uses a system of abbreviations in the notes field for
            each entry. The abbreviations are listed at the
            <a href="https://ntireader.org/abbreviations.html"
            >Abbreviations</a> page. The references for general entries are at
            the Chinese Notes <a href="https://chinesenotes.com/references.html"
            >References</a> page. The FGS sources are listed here at the
            HB Reader <a href="https://hbreader.org/fgs_references.html"
            >References</a> page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The references for most entries are listed in the notes. However,
            there are many entries with no reference listed. I added those at an
            early stage of the NTI Reader and am gradually adding the
            references. For the quotations from English translations of
            canonical texts, I list myself as the translator to make it clear
            that I have not copied from the published translation. For example,
            <a href="https://ntireader.org/words/2001173.html">夫宗極絕於稱謂</a>.

            Answer: See the <a href="help.html">Help</a>

            page <a href="translation_workflow.html">Translation of Chinese

            Question: Is this a Chinese-English dictionary?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: Yes. The project started out as a generic Chinese-English
            dictionary and works OK for general use. A full Chinese-English
            dictionary is used to assist in analyzing corpora of Chinese
            Buddhist texts without the reader having to switch between a
            literary Chinese-English dictionary and a Buddhist Chinese dictionary.

            Question: What is a dictionary entry?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: Headwords dictionary entries can be a word, a freqently
            occurring phrase, or the name person, place, or organization, with a
            mapping to another languages. The mappings supported today are
            Chinese to English and Sanskrit to Chinese with English. Because of
            the search capabilities the dictionary can be searched in reverse
            order and for complete phrases as well. The body of dictionary
            entries includes a list of word senses and how the word is used in
            the texts forming the corpus.

            Question: Is this a research project?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: The NTI Reader is more of a sequence of experiments than a
            coherent research project. The project has evolved through personal
            study, use in volunteer translation at Fo Guang Shan, and academic
            study.

            Question: What are the current issues and problems with the NTI
            Reader?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: There are a number of issues listed in the Github repository
            <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/issues"
            >issues folder</a>. One fairly major issue is that Siddhaṃ
            characters and images cannot be displayed in the NTI Reader. This
            is discussed in detail in issue 5 <a
            href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/issues/5"
            >Special Text, Image Elements and Nonstandard Layouts</a>.
