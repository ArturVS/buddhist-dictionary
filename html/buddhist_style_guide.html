<h2>Dictionary Style Guide for Buddhist Terms</h2>
<p>
  This page describes the things to consider when writing a Buddhist-specific 
  dictionary entry. When writing entries for generic Chinese words, see the
  chinesenote.com <a href='http://chinesenotes.com/style_guide.html'>Style
  Guide</a>. For a description of the structure of the metadata used in the 
  NTI Reader see the page <a href="ntireader_metadata.html"

</p>
<h3>Dictionary Entry Components</h3>
<h4>Headwords</h4>
<p>
  Headwords are uniquely defined by the traditional writing of the word.
  There is no difference between Buddhist and regular headwords and they are
  not divided in the words.txt file.
</p>
<h4>Word id</h4>
<p>
  Each lexical unit has a unique word id.
</p>
<h4>Simplified Chinese</h4>
<p>
  The Simplified Chinese field is compulsory.
</p>
<h4>Traditional Chinese</h4>
<p>
  The Traditional Chinese field is only added if the traditional Chinese
  text is different from the simplified Chinese.
</p>
<h4>Pinyin</h4>
<p>
  The Pinyin field is mandatory.
</p>
<h4>Grammar</h4>
<p>
  The Grammar field indicates part of speech and is mandatory. Most Buddhist
  terms will be either nouns, proper nouns for people or places, or set phrases.
  Fixed expressions like 四聖諦 sì shèng dì 'four noble truths' should be
  assigned 'set phrase' for the value of this field.
</p>
<h4>English Equivalents</h4>
<p>
  The English field is mandatory. Many Buddhist terms have Sanskrit or Pali
  origin. The International Alphabet for Sanksrit Transliteration (IAST) should 
  be included for these in additional to an English equivalent.
  See <a href='sanskrit_in_buddhism.html'>Understanding Buddhist Sanskrit 
  Terms</a> for details on IAST. To help users search for the Sanskrit or Pali
  term, include a plain Latin equivalent as well. For example, for
  煩惱 fánnǎo include the English equivalents kleśa / klesa / mental affliction.
  The exact Sanskrit and Pali orthography can be explained in detail in the 
  Notes field.
  For terms that have a Chinese, Japanese, or Korean origin include the 
  Pinyin, Japanese, or Korean writing of the term.
</p>
<p>
  Follow the Wisdom Publications’ Style Guid for books on Indian and Tibetan
  Buddhism for other details on style. In particular, use lower case letters
  for enumerations. For example, 
</p>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p>
  Concept is an optional field. Frequently used values for Buddhist terms are
  法师 Monastic, 寺院 Temple, and 典籍 Canonical Text.
</p>
<h4>Domain Labels</h4>
<p>
  For Buddhist terms the Domain Label should always be set to 佛教 Buddhism.
  The Subdomain Label is optional. Frequently used values are 
  大乘佛教 Mahāyāna Buddhism, 密教 Esoteric Buddhism, and 
  中国佛教 Chinese Buddhism.
</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>
  For terms originating from a Sanskrit word the Sanskrit, Pali, and Japanese
  forms should be included. For example,
  'From Sanskrit: sūtra, Pāli: sutta, Japanese: kyō; ...'
  Although most notes in the dictionary use simplified Chinese text where
  needed, notes on Buddhist terms should use traditional Chinese. The reason
  for this is to match the traditional text in the Taishō.
</p>
<p>
  Notes should include references using the system of 
  <a href='abbreviations.html'>Abbreviations</a> used in the
  NTI Reader dictionary.
