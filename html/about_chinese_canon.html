<h3>About the Chinese Buddhist Canon</h3>
<p>
  NTI Reader uses Chinese text from the <a href="taisho.html">Taishō Shinshū 
  Daizōkyō</a>, which means 
  ‘Taishō Revised Tripiṭaka’ (Takakusu Junjiro 1988). The actual text used was
  digitized by the <a href='http://cbeta.org/'>CBETA project</a> (Wittern 2006).
  The Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō (Taishō) is based on the Korean canon (Lancaster
  2004, Introduction). CBETA has made the text freely available under a Creative
  Commons License (CBETA 2017a, ‘Taishō Tripiṭaka’) for volumes 1-55 of the
  Taishō, which are the ones used in the NTI Reader. Volume 55 is partial.
  This includes most of the Chinese content of the Taishō. The remainder is
  Japanese commentaries, Siddhaṃ texts, and artwork. You can view the entire
  contents Taishō at the <a href="http://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT/ddb-bdk-sat2.php"

 The Korean version of the Chinese Buddhist Canon is based on was printed from
 blocks that were carved over the period 1236-1251. After the Kaibao canon was
 taken to Korea, the Chinese canon kept evolving. Each major dynasty, including
 the Yuan, Ming, and Qing produced their own versions under the sponsorship of
 the Chinese imperial court (Fo Guang Shan 2000, s.v. ‘中文大藏經’). One of the
 best known and most widely distributed versions of these was the 龍藏 Lóng Zàng
 produced in 1738. Production of modern versions continued this tradition in the
 Republican period and in Taiwan after 1949. Partial digitizations of many of
 these versions of the Chinese Buddhist canon have been digitized and are
 available on the CBETA web site (CBETA 2017b, “Hanwen Dazangjing
 《漢文大藏經》”). The 佛光大藏經 “Fo Guang Buddhist Canon” was published by Fo
 Guang Shan in 1977 (Fo Guang Shan 2000, s.v. ‘中文大藏經’).

  The Taishō introduced a modern numbering system with roughly chronological
  ordering. This revolutionized the classification system of the canon and
  replaced the <i>Thousand Character Classic</i> index used by historic versions
  (Wu 2016, loc. 705). Previous versions of the canon placed Prajñāpāramitā
  at the beginning of the canon in accordance with Tiantai theory of the Mahāyāna
  teachings were the ultimate teachings of the Buddha. The Taishō places the
  Āgamas in accordance with modern scholarly understanding that they most
  closely match the original teachings of the Buddha.
