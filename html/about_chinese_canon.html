<h2>About the Chinese Buddhist Canon</h2>
<p>
  NTI Reader uses Chinese text from the <a class='regular' href="/taisho/taisho.html">Taishō
  Shinshū Daizōkyō</a>, which means 
  ‘Taishō Revised Tripiṭaka’ (Takakusu Junjiro 1988). The actual text used was
  digitized by the <a href='http://cbeta.org/'>CBETA project</a> (Wittern 2006).
  The Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō (Taishō) is based on the Korean canon (Lancaster
  2004, Introduction). CBETA has made the text freely available under a Creative
  Commons License (CBETA 2017a, ‘Taishō Tripiṭaka’) for volumes 1-55 of the
  Taishō, which are the ones used in the NTI Reader. Volume 55 is partial.
  This includes most of the Chinese content of the Taishō. The remainder is
  Japanese commentaries, Siddhaṃ texts, and artwork. You can view the entire
  contents and scanned manuscript images of the Taishō at the <a class='regular' 
  href="http://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT/ddb-bdk-sat2.php">SAT website</a>.
</p>
<h4 id="background">Historic Background</h4>
<p>
 The Korean version of the Chinese Buddhist Canon is based on was printed from
 blocks that were carved over the period 1236-1251. After the Kaibao canon was
 taken to Korea, the Chinese canon kept evolving. Each major dynasty, including
 the Yuan, Ming, and Qing produced their own versions under the sponsorship of
 the Chinese imperial court (Fo Guang Shan 2000, s.v. ‘中文大藏經’). One of the
 best known and most widely distributed versions of these was the 龍藏 Lóng Zàng
 produced in 1738. Production of modern versions continued this tradition in the
 Republican period and in Taiwan after 1949. Partial digitizations of many of
 these versions of the Chinese Buddhist canon have been digitized and are
 available on the CBETA <a class='regular' href="http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/">Hanwen Dazangjing</a> 
 (《漢文大藏經》) page. The 佛光大藏經 “Fo Guang Buddhist Canon” was published by Fo
 Guang Shan in 1977 (Fo Guang Shan 2000, s.v. ‘中文大藏經’). The later Chinese
 versions of the canon contains texts that are not in the Taishō.
</p>
<p>
  The Taishō was the first version of the Chinese Buddhist canon to be
  substantially influenced by modern Western scholarship. Nanjo Bunyu 南条文雄
  (1849-1907) studied at Oxford University under Max Müller. Nanjo Bunyu compiled
  <i>A Catalogue of the Chinese translation of the Buddhist Tripitaka</i> in
  Sanskrit and Enlish based on the Ming Canon, which includes titles for
  1662 works with notes on translators, prefaces, and relations between source
  texts (Nanjio 1883, p. xi).
</p>
<p>
  The Taishō introduced a modern numbering system with roughly chronological
  ordering. This revolutionized the classification system of the canon and
  replaced the <i>Thousand Character Classic</i> index used by historic versions
  (Wu 2016, loc. 705). Previous versions of the canon placed Prajñāpāramitā
  at the beginning of the canon in accordance with Tiantai theory of the Mahāyāna
  teachings were the ultimate teachings of the Buddha. The Taishō places the
  Āgamas in accordance with modern scholarly understanding that they probably 
  most closely match the earliest teachings. The Āgamas in volumes 1-2 of the
  Taishō are closely related to the Pali Nikāya. 
</p>
<p>
  There are 2,239 Chinese texts included in the NTI Reader. The Korean version
  that the Taishō is based on was printed from blocks that were carved over the
  period 1236-1251 and includes 1,512 titles (Lancaster 2004, Introduction).
  There are some Chinese texts in the Taishō that come from later periods. 
</p>
<p>
   The development of East Asian Buddhist canons includes extensive historic
   scholarly work in compiling, cataloging and investigation of textual
   authority (Wu and Chia 2016, loc. 297-447). Early catalogs, such as the
   <i>Collection of Records Concerning the Chinese Buddhist Canon</i>
   出三藏記集 (T 2125), are themselves included in the Taishō in Volume 55.
   Long and Chen (2020) have an extensive discussion of this.
</p>
<p>
  The coverage of the Taishō is mostly before the Yuan dynasty. There are a
  small number of texts composed in the Yuan, Ming, and Qing. However, if you
  are looking for later texts, you should see the 
  卍字正續藏經 <a class='regular' href="http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/X">Manji-zōkyō</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="searching">Searching the Canon</h3>
<p>
  You can do a full text search of the Taishō with the NTI Reader. Also, when
  looking at an individual term, a list of there that term will be found in the
  canon will be shown.
  You can also use SAT and CBETA to search the canon. It may be worth searching
  multiple if you do not find the results that you expect because each tool has
  a different coverage and different handling of groups of characters, and
  variant characters.
</p>
<h3 id="structure">Language and Structure</h3>
<p>
  The Chinese canon was written over a very long period stretching from the
  Later Han to the Qing. This period is mostly too late to be considered
  classical Chinese and too early to be considered modern Chinese. The
  NTI Reader uses the label ‘Literary Chinese’ to describe this for want of a
  better term. In addition, there are many terms transliterated from Sanskrit
  with Chinese characters. The NTI Reader groups characters into words so that
  you can easily recognize them. You can mouseover or click on the terms to
  find out more about them. The <a class='regular' href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/"
  >CBETA Online Reader</a> also provides help in reading canonical text.
  For learning the language of the canon see 
  <a class='regular' href="http://www.primerbuddhism.org/">A Primer in Chinese Buddhist Writings</a>.
  by John Kieschnick. 
</p>
<p>
  The Taishō is divided into volumes. Each volume contains a number of works.
  These works are given numbers beginning at 1. For example, 長阿含經 Dīrghāgama
  (Long Discourses) in Volume 1 is
  <a class='regular' href="https://ntireader.org/taisho/t0001.html">T1</a>. The NTI Reader
  terminology for work is ‘collection.’ Each collection consists of a number of
  卷 scrolls or fasciles, which is a single HTML page or document in the 
  NTI Reader. For example, T1 has 22 scrolls. Some collections only have a single
  scroll.
</p>
<p>
  The structure of individual texts in the canon may be different to
  individual texts published for Buddhist practitioners by temples.
  For example, the version in the canon will typically include a historical
  preface that is not included in the individual publications. Also,
  the individual publications may include chapter titles not included in the
  canonical versions. See the individual publications at the 
  <a class='regular' href="https://www.fgsitc.org/practices-prayers-english-texts/"
  >Practices and Prayers Texts</a> page of the Fo Guang Shan International
  Translation Center for examples.
