<h3>About the Chinese Buddhist Canon</h3>
<p>
  NTI Reader uses Chinese text from the <a href="/taisho/taisho.html">Taishō
  Shinshū Daizōkyō</a>, which means 
  ‘Taishō Revised Tripiṭaka’ (Takakusu Junjiro 1988). The actual text used was
  digitized by the <a href='http://cbeta.org/'>CBETA project</a> (Wittern 2006).
  The Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō (Taishō) is based on the Korean canon (Lancaster
  2004, Introduction). CBETA has made the text freely available under a Creative
  Commons License (CBETA 2017a, ‘Taishō Tripiṭaka’) for volumes 1-55 of the
  Taishō, which are the ones used in the NTI Reader. Volume 55 is partial.
  This includes most of the Chinese content of the Taishō. The remainder is
  Japanese commentaries, Siddhaṃ texts, and artwork. You can view the entire
  contents Taishō at the <a

 The Korean version of the Chinese Buddhist Canon is based on was printed from
 blocks that were carved over the period 1236-1251. After the Kaibao canon was
 taken to Korea, the Chinese canon kept evolving. Each major dynasty, including
 the Yuan, Ming, and Qing produced their own versions under the sponsorship of
 the Chinese imperial court (Fo Guang Shan 2000, s.v. ‘中文大藏經’). One of the
 best known and most widely distributed versions of these was the 龍藏 Lóng Zàng
 produced in 1738. Production of modern versions continued this tradition in the
 Republican period and in Taiwan after 1949. Partial digitizations of many of
 these versions of the Chinese Buddhist canon have been digitized and are
 available on the CBETA <a href="http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/">Hanwen Dazangjing</a> 
 (《漢文大藏經》) page. The 佛光大藏經 “Fo Guang Buddhist Canon” was published by Fo
 Guang Shan in 1977 (Fo Guang Shan 2000, s.v. ‘中文大藏經’). The later Chinese
 versions of the canon contains texts that are not in the Taishō.

<p>
  The Taishō was the first version of the Chinese Buddhist canon to be
  substantially influenced by modern Western scholarship. Nanjo Bunyu 南条文雄
  (1849-1907) studied at Oxford University under Max Müller. Nanjo Bunyu compiled
  <i>A Catalogue of the Chinese translation of the Buddhist Tripitaka</i> in
  Sanskrit and Enlish based on the Ming Canon, which includes titles for
  1662 works with notes on translators, prefaces, and relations between source
  texts (Nanjio 1883, p. xi).
</p>
<p>
  The Taishō introduced a modern numbering system with roughly chronological
  ordering. This revolutionized the classification system of the canon and
  replaced the <i>Thousand Character Classic</i> index used by historic versions
  (Wu 2016, loc. 705). Previous versions of the canon placed Prajñāpāramitā
  at the beginning of the canon in accordance with Tiantai theory of the Mahāyāna
  teachings were the ultimate teachings of the Buddha. The Taishō places the
  Āgamas in accordance with modern scholarly understanding that they probably 
  most closely match the earliest teachings. The Āgamas in volumes 1-2 of the
  Taishō are closely related to the Pali Nikāya. 
</p>
<p>
  There are 2,239 Chinese texts included in the NTI Reader. The Korean version
  that the Taishō is based on was printed from blocks that were carved over the
  period 1236-1251 and includes 1,512 titles (Lancaster 2004, Introduction).
  There are some Chinese texts in the Taishō that come from later periods.

<p>
   The development of East Asian Buddhist canons includes extensive historic
   scholarly work in compiling, cataloging and investigation of textual
   authority (Wu and Chia 2016, loc. 297-447). Early catalogs, such as the
   <i>Collection of Records Concerning the Chinese Buddhist Canon</i>
   《出三藏記集》 (T 2125), are themselves included in the Taishō in Volume 55.
