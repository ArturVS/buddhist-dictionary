      <h2>Using the NTI Reader as a Translation Aid</h2>
      <p>
        One of the main purposes of the NTI Reader is to help translators.
        This page describes the ways that the web site can be used in 
        different translation workflows. Canonical texts included on the site
        may be used to help translate or the site may be used to translate
        general Buddhist texts. 
        Answers to more general questions are in the <a href="faq.html">Frequently 
        Asked Questions</a> page.

      <h3 id="start">Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
        Several of the most immediate benefits of using the NTI Reader for
        translation are that 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          It can save you time by looking up many words at the same time 
        </li>
        <li>
          You can look at the dictionary definitions for whole phrases or
          sentences at one time.
        </li>
        <li>
          The NTI Reader contains a large number of Buddhist terms, literary
          Chinese words, and modern Chinese words, which saves you from having
          to buy and consult a collection of different specialist dictionaries.
          If you do need more information on a term, the NTI Reader helps with
          references using a system of <a
          href='/abbreviations.html'>abbreviations</a> in the dictionary entry
          notes.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Translation involves more than just looking up words. Translation
        needs to consider the lexicon, the syntactic structure of each
        language, and the message that the source text describes (Vinay &amp;
        Darbelnet 1995, pp. 11-12). The NTI Reader aims to help translators
        by allowing them to look at the English equivalents of many Chinese
        words at one time and to drill down on individual Chinese words to
        relate these back to their use in canonical texts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation can be difficult for any document because of a
        number of different challenges, including the different structure,
        conventions, and cultural conventions of the two languages and their
        environments (Vinay &amp; Darbelnet 1995, p. 4).
        Translation of a canonical text will be especially difficult because it
        will start with the challenging task of understanding a source text
        written in a very different time and culture.
        This will most likely start with a document analysis that may include
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Reading the source document, historic or modern, and using the web site to 
          understand more about certain words or phrases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Getting a sense of an untranslated historic document. A full
          translation may not be feasible initially but you want to get an
          overall sense of the content and nature of the document, say by
          examining the keywords.
        </li>
        <li>
          Commentary or summary in a modern language, say from a secondary
          source, such as an encyclopedia.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="terminology">Translation Terminology</h3>
      <p>
        Here is an explantion of some of the terms used in the remainder of this
        page:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Source text</em> - the Chinese text that you are translating from
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Target text</em> - the English text that you are translating to
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Github</em> - the <a 
          href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary">repository</a>
          of the source code and linguistic artifacts for the NTI Reader,
          including revision history.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>collocation</em> - a combination of words that occurs together
          more commonly than can be accounted for by coincidence. For example,
          in modern English “strong tea” but not “powerful tea” and a
          “power breakfast” but not a “strong breakfast”.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="casual">Casual Use for a Private Translation</h3>
      <p>
        In this workflow a user does not join the GitHub project or have contact
        with the NTI Reader site owner but simply wants to use the web site as
        tool for a private translation. The user has
        their own private copy of the document and does not wish to share it.
        The user wants to use the site to search word meanings and for translation
        memory.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Phrases or words are cut-and-paste from the private Word document into the
          word or phrase search page to find the word meanings.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a word is found that is not in the dictionary then the user can
          email the site onwer at alex@ntireader.org with the additional
          vocabulary to add.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user can copy material from the web site under the terms of the 
          <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative 
          Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License</a> license.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="collaborative">Collaborative Translation</h3>
      <p>
        In this workflow a user will either <a href="faq.html#join">join the
        GitHub project</a> or send linguistic artifacts to the site owner by
        email. Typically, the linguistic artifacts will be either entries to
        the <a
        href='https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/blob/master/data/dictionary/words.txt'>words</a>
        file containing more or changed vocabulary or corrections to
        the files containing the canonical text. The artifacts can be added
        to the site and the dictionary and / or corpus rebuilt.
      </p>
      <h3 id="sense">Getting the Sense of a Canonical Text</h3>
      <p>
        In this workflow the user wants to get the overall sense of a document
        in the Taisho.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Find the document in the <a href='/taisho/taisho.html'>Table of
          Contents</a> and browse the text. Mouse over the Chinese text to get
          a quick sense of the meaning and click on any word to get a full
          definition that also relates the word to how it is used in the canon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look at the content analysis for the text. A link for a content
          analysis for each text is given at the bottom of the colophon page
          for each document. The content analysis includes a list of
          proper nouns, frequencies of lexical words, frequencies of all words,
          and bigrams ordered by frequency. For example, for the
          <i>Treatise on the Awakening of Faith in the Mahāyāna</i> 《大乘起信論》
          (T 1666) the colophon page is <a href='/taisho/t1666.html'>here</a>
          and the content analysis is <a 
          href='/analysis/taisho/t1666_analysis.html'>here</a>. This may be
          useful for terminology extraction.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="style">Style</h3>
      <p>
        Language <em>tone</em> relates to the context it is used in and is
        indicated by word choice and other stylistic choices. For example,
        the modern English word 'deceased' indicates an administrative tone,
        while 'dead' indicates a conversational tone (Vinay &amp; Darbelnet 1995,
        pp. 17-18). In translation of text from a modern source language to a
        modern target language the tone is usually preserved in the translation
        process. However, this is most often not the case for translation of
        historic texts, including canonical Buddhist texts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tone and style of translated Buddhist texts will usually vary with
        the intended audience. A target audience of lay Buddhist readers will
        probably appreciate a more digestable form compared with a target
        audience of Buddhist scholars will appreciate greater precision,
        and already be familiar with basic terminology. For example,
        consider translation of the term 公案 gōng'àn “kōan” or “gong'an”. A lay
        readership will probably more easily understand “koan”, without the
        diacritics, which is a word now included in general English dictionaries,
        such as the <a 
        href='https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/koan'>Oxford Living
        Dictionary</a>. A translation for a scholarly audience will probably
        prefer to use the term “gong'an” for a Chinese Buddhist text or
        “kōan” with diacritics for a Japanese canonical text.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sanskrit and Pali words are particularly numerous in canonical texts.
        Take the word 大悲 dàbēi “mahākaruṇā” or “great compassion”.
        A lay audience will probably prefer an English equivalent 
        “great compassion” The problem with this is that it would be a
        guess to back translate from that English equivalent to
        the source word. This might be thought of as an imprecise translation
        by a scholarly audience, who may prefer “mahākaruṇā”, which the 
        diacritics. This is one reason that the NTI Reader includes several
        English equivalents and an indication in the notes of which are
        Sanskrit, Pali, and Japanese. The NTI Reader uses the International
        Alphabet for Sanskrit Transliteration for diacritics of Sanskrit
        words, as described in the NTI Reader <a
        href='http://ntireader.org/buddhist_style_guide.html'>Style Guide</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Larger translation projects will generally use a style guide.
        If your project does not have one, you may consider consulting the <a
        href="http://www.wisdompubs.org/sites/default/files/WisdomStyleGuide201308.pdf"
        >Wisdom Publications’ Style Guide</a> for books on Indian and Tibetan
        Buddhism, although it may not be sufficient for Chinese texts.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many more nuances to style in translation than this. For
        example, if the Chinese is itself a transliteration of a Sanskrit
        word then it may be best to keep the Sanskrit form in the target text.

      <h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        Translation methodologies are often guided by linguistics. Vinay and 
        Darbelnet developed a translation approach based on early modern 
        linguistics in the 1950s (Malmkjær, 2011, p. 58-60). Thier approach
        views the translation process from the three levels of lexis, syntax,
        and message. One of the important aspects of their method is
        consideration of cultural context for both the source and target
        languages. The the approach of Catford lexis is dealt with using
        collocations and lexical sets (Malmkjær, 2011, p. 60-62). Nida's
        approach emphasizes grammatical structure using concepts from 
        Chomsky's generative grammar (Malmkjær, 2011, p. 62-64). Bells approach
        and Halverson's approaches emphasize psycholinguistics and cognitive
        linguistics respectively (Malmkjær, 2011, p. 64-67).
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the classic translation methodology text by Vinay and 
        Darbelnet, a <em>translation unit</em> is “the smallest segment of the
        utterance whose signs a linked in such a way that they should not be
        translated individually” (Vinay &amp; Darbelnet 1995, p. 21). They
        recognise several types of translation units
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Functional units</em> - forming a syntactic group, for example,
          “at a location”
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Semantic units</em> - having a unit of meaning, for example,
          “main feature”
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Dialectic units</em> - expressing a unit of reasoning, for example,
          “on the other hand”
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Prosodic units</em> - with the same intonation, for example,
          “You there!”
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The NTI Reader can assist you identify translation units by (1) giving
        a holistic view of a sentence and (2) through finding collocations
        for specific words. Consider the word 求 qiú 'to seek'. Looking at the
        detail page for this word you will find the collocation 求利 qiú lì
        “to seek profit”, which may help you identify the translation unit
        and choose a combination of English equivalents that fit well
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nida is a modern Bible translation scholar that has continued a
        tradition of religious translation. Nida distinguished two types of
        translation based on syntactical structure: ‘formal equivalence’ and 
        ‘dynamic equivalence.’ Formal equivalence preserves the grammatical 
        structure of the source language. Dynamic equivalence reorganizes the 
        syntactic structure to read more naturally in the target language
        (Barnes 2011, pp. 44-46). Although the early version generative grammar
        that Nida's theory is based on is somewhat out of date now the concept
        of formal equivalence in contrast with dynamic equivalence is an
        informative idea.
      </p>
      <h3 id="terminology_extraction">Terminology Extraction</h3>
      <p>
        Terminology is vocabulary for a specialized domain. Buddhism has a very
        large amount of terminology and this includes subdomains and genres with
        their own terminology. Terminology extraction tools are software aids
        that help compile glossaries for terminology (Kenny, 2011, pp. 462-463).
        Although the NTI Reader was not specifically designed as a terminology
        extraction tool it has general corpus analysis features that can help
        in terminology extraction.
        The <a href='analysis/corpus_analysis.html'>Corpus Analysis</a> of the
        Taishō version of the Chinese Buddhist canon may be used to help
        extract terminology for the canon as a whole. The corpus analysis
        includes frequencies of lexical words, frequencies of all words, and
        frequencies of bigrams. Frequency lists of of lexical words exclude
        commonly occuring <em>stop words</em>, that are mainly function words
        that occur very frequently.
        Individual word entries relate the words back
        to the corpus with listing by frequency of occurrence, collocations,
        and usage examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corpus Analysis includes 
        <a href="/analysis/corpus_analysis.html#genre">Frequencies of Lexical
        Words by Genre</a>, for genres such as āgama, jātaka, and avadāna.
        Individual texts include content analysis for the text, including
        proper nouns, rrequencies of lexical words, frequencies of all words,
        and bigrams.
      </p>
      <h3 id="collocations">Collocations</h3>
      <p>
        A <em>collocation</em> is a combination of words occurring together by
        convention rather than by free selection (Svensén 2009, pp. 158-159).
        For example, the word combinations ‘arouse suspicion’ and ‘notorious
        thief’ are collocations. It is important for L2 speakers to be made
        aware of the convention formed by the collocation, which would not
        otherwise be obvious (Svensén 2009, pp. 166-167). Collocations are also
        a good source of examples and translators may treat them as translation
        units.
      </p>
      <p>
        How can we find the words, word senses, and names of people and places
        in a corpus? The process of vocabulary acquisition can be done by: 
        1. Reading texts manually. 2. Scanning texts automatically looking for
        characters not appearing in the dictionary, 3. examining collocations
        and 4. examining words of frequency since the most frequent words tend
        to have the greatest polysemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corpora may be are used by lexicographers to perform word sense
        disambiguation in dictionary compilation (Atkins and Rundell 2008,
        loc. 3316-3324). Collocations and concordances are  the primary tools
        for this. For example, the word 法 fǎ, which may mean ‘law,’ ‘method,’
        or one of several senses of ‘dharma’. In this example the collocation 
      </p>
      <pre>
        法殿
        fǎ diàn
        Dharma + hall
      </pre>
      <p>
        Could only mean Dharma in the sense of the teachings of the Buddha,
        since the following word is the hall that the Dharma is studied. The
        example sentence confirms this
      </p>
      <pre>
        造立法殿
        zàolì fǎ diàn
        Build + dharma + hall -> “build a Dharma hall”
      </pre>
      <p>
        Collocations may be dictionary entries themselves. For example, the
        collocation 染法 rǎn fǎ ‘polluting dharma’ appears twelve times in the 
        <i>Awakening of Faith</i> and is listed as an entry in the FGDB, which
        explains that it is a synonym of 煩惱 fánnǎo kleśa ‘mental affliction’ 
        (FGDB, s.v. ‘染法’).
      </p>
      <p>
        Svensén mentions that inclusion of collocations is a measure of
        dictionary quality and discusses how they should be included at length
        (Svensén 2009, pp. 169-183). While some collocations are included in
        the NTI Reader dictionary, most are included automatically from corpus
        analysis. Collocations are treated in the NTI Reader as two adjacent
        words. However, this is a gross simplification. For example, the English
        collocation “strong tea” can be modified to a number of combinations,
        such as a “strong cup of tea” or a “strong pot of tea.” This highlights
        a grammatical dimension that is not accounted for by any of the
        capabilities of the NTI Reader.
