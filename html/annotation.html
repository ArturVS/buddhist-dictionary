<h2>Text Management and Chinese Text Reader for the Chinese Buddhist Canon</h2>
<p>
  This page gives an introduction on the methodology used to analyze the 
  Chinese Buddhist canon, as presented on this web site. The Chinese text reader
  for the <a href='taisho/taisho.html'>Taishō shinshū daizōkyō</a> 
  《大正新脩大藏經》 Buddhist canon was generated using a freely available tool
  <a
  href="https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com/tree/master/go/src/cnreader"
  title="Command line tool on GitHub">cnreader</a>. The HTML pages generated
  were uploaded to this web site to be available to web users. The source of the
  texts is the <a href='http://cbeta.org/'>CBETA</a> web site, which distributes
  the texts freely under a <a

  wonderful contribution to the general public and subsequently makes the

<h3>Background</h2>
<p>
  The collection of texts in this web site are managed as a <i>text corpus</i>.
  A text corpus, or simply <i>corpus</i>, is a term used in linguistics to 
  mean a representative collection of texts used to 
  study the linguistic characteristics of a language. 
  The Brown Corpus, first published in 1961 [Francis 1964], was the first large corpus developed.
  It consists of about 1 million English words.
  The corpus of Chinese texts from the Taishō used on this site has 59,069,881
  words with 33,200 unique words, and 73,414,250 characters, according the 
  summary of the <a href='analysis/corpus_analysis.html'>Corpus Analysis</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Each corpus entry includes meta data about a primary source document, such as
  the source and links to plain text versions, English translations, vocabulary
  analysis, and other information.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Gloss</i> is a form of annotation that explains the meanings of words in texts.
  A collection of glosses is called a <i>glossary</i>.
  A historic example is Biblical gloss that was used to annotate the meanings of
  words in the Bible. Biblical gloss was usually added in margins and included
  commentaries as well. <i>Interlinear gloss</i> is gloss added between the lines.
  Historic annotations are valuable in themselves and may
  give explainations of the source text that would not be known otherwise.
  However, they have often been ommitted when documents were new versions of 
  documents were published, retaining the original text only.
</p>
<p>
  Gloss is also used in a modern context by linguists to help them study and 
  discuss languages that they cannot understand themselves. Typically, this 
  kind of gloss in added after the native terms in square brackets, such as
  佛 [Buddha]. Besides the meaning of foreign words in English, linguists also
  sometimes indicate pronunciation with gloss.
  The Penn Chinese Treebank has a particular style of gloss used
  that includes gloss for indivual words in square brackets and angle brackets
  for the phrase as a whole [Nianwen 2005]. For example, 乘 [riding] 白 [white] 
  象 [elephant] &lt;riding a white elephant&gt;.
  This web site follows that style with a mouse-over for the convenience
  of readers.
</p>
<h3>Corpus management</h3>
<p>
  Each corpus entry has a text file that uses a markdown file. Markdown is a plain
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> can allow people who are not 
  software or web design specialists to easily work with plain text that can be transformed
  to HTML later. Markdown consists of simple and intuitive patterns, such has headers and 
  bullet lists for making plan text more readable.  This makes it easy to add annotations to
  primary source documents or copies of them.
</p>
<p>
  The collection of primary texts and markdown documents is through a set of 
  tab separated variable files.

<h3>Word Frequency Analysis</h3>
<p>
  After documents have been tagged they can be used to compile bigram and unigram word frequencies,
  which helps with word sense disambiguation. This is discussed more on the page 
  <a href="word_freq.html">Word Frequency Analysis</a> on this site and in the book 
  Natural Language Processing with Python by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein and Edward Loper.
