  The content of the NTI Reader is the Chinese text from the 《大正新脩大藏經》 
  Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō or ‘Taishō Revised Tripiṭaka’ (Takakusu Junjiro 1988), 
  referred to here as the Taishō. The digitized version of volumes 1-55 was 
  downloaded from the <a href="http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/T"> CBETA web site</a>.
  The CBETA project made an agreement with the University of Tokyo for
  reproduction and free redistribution of volumes 1-55 and 85 (Huimin 2000).
  CBETA subsequently made the text freely available under a Creative Commons
  License. See the page <a href="about_chinese_canon.html">About the Chinese
  Buddhist Canon</a> for more background on the Chinese Buddhist canon itself.
</p>
<p>
  Besides the metadata on the CBETA web site, much of the metadata from
  <i><a href="http://www.acmuller.net/descriptive_catalogue/"
  >The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalogue</a></i> by
  Lancaster. See the page <a
  href="http://ntireader.org/about_chinese_canon.html">About the Chinese
  Buddhist Canon</a> for more background on the Taishō and the Korean Canon.
  For more details on the content and structure of the metadata see the page <a
  href="ntireader_metadata.html">Metadata Used in the NTI Reader</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The NTI Reader has several features that are intended to make it easier
  for users, including: (1) text segmentation, (2) automatic matching of
  words in the text to the dictionary with a summary on mouseover and linking
  to the dictionary definitions (3) highlighting of proper nouns in order to
  facilitate comparison of different versions of a text using the proper 
  nouns as markers. Text segmentation means that multi-character words are
  grouped together from the stream of Chinese characters. This is a point of
  difficulty for non-native Chinese speakers because Chinese text has no
  spaces. It may be useful to native Chinese speakers as well because of the
  large number of multi-character words of Sanskrit origin in the canon.

<p>
  The Chinese text reader
  for the Taishō was generated using a freely available tool
  <a
  href="https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com/tree/master/go/src/cnreader"
  title="Command line tool on GitHub">cnreader</a>. The HTML pages generated
  were uploaded to this web site to be available to web users. The source of the
  texts is the <a href='http://cbeta.org/'>CBETA</a> web site, which distributes
  the texts freely under a <a 
  href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/tw/'>Creative
  Commons</a> license. The NTI Reader Project is very thankful to CEBTA for this
  wonderful contribution to the general public and subsequently makes the 
  content of the NTI Reader freely available under an English version of the 
  same license.
</p>
<p>
  The cnreader tool analyzes all the text files making up volumes 1-55 of the
  Taishō, does text segmentation to find the words with the stream of
  characters, and generates HTML files with links for each word to a 
  Chinese-English word definition. A user can mouse over a word to see a brief
  defintion and can click on the word for the full detail on a separate HTML
  page.
</p>
<p>
  The collection of texts in this web site are managed as a <i>text corpus</i>.
  A text <i>corpus</i> is a term used in linguistics to mean a representative
  collection of texts used to study the linguistic characteristics of a 
  language. It is not necessary for users of the site to know anything on
  corpus analysis to use the site effectively but more details about
  the corpus building and analysis aspects of the project can be found at <a
  href="word_freq.html">Introduction to Corpus Analysis of the Chinese Buddhist
  Canon</a>.
  The corpus of Chinese texts from the Taishō used on this site has 59,069,881
  words with 33,200 unique words and 73,414,250 characters, according the 
  summary of the <a href='analysis/corpus_analysis.html'>Corpus Analysis</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Each corpus entry includes metadata about a primary source document, such as
  the source and links to plain text versions, English translations, vocabulary
  analysis, and other information.  Each corpus entry has a text file that uses
  a separate markdown file. This allows metadata to be added without changing
  the source text of the canon.
  Markdown is a plain
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> can allow for 
  people who are not software or web design specialists to easily work with
  plain text that can be transformed to HTML later. Markdown consists of simple
  and intuitive patterns, such has headers and bullet lists for making plan
  text more readable. This makes it easy to add annotations to
  primary source documents or copies of them.
</p>
<p>
  The collection of primary texts and markdown documents is through a set of 
  tab separated variable files.
