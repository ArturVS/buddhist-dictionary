<h2>Description of the NTI Reader</h2>
<p>
  This page gives a description of what is included with the NTI Buddhist Text
  Reader (NTI Reader) on this web site.
  The NTI Reader presents the <i><a href='taisho/taisho.html'>Taishō Shinshū 
  Daizōkyō</a></i> 《大正新脩大藏經》 (Taishō) version of the Chinese Buddhist canon.
  The content of the Taishō was downloaded from the digitized version on the <a
  href="http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/T">CBETA</a> web site.

  Besides the metadata on the CBETA web site, much of the metadata from
  <i><a href="http://www.acmuller.net/descriptive_catalogue/"
  >The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalogue</a></i> by
  Lancaster. See the page <a
  href="http://ntireader.org/about_chinese_canon.html">About the Chinese
  Buddhist Canon</a> for more background on the Taishō and the Korean Canon.
  For more details on the content and structure of the metadata see the page <a
  href="ntireader_metadata.html">Metadata Used in the NTI Reader</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The NTI Reader has several features that are intended to make it easier
  for users, including: (1) text segmentation, (2) automatic matching of
  words in the text to the dictionary with a summary on mouseover and linking
  to the dictionary definitions (3) highlighting of proper nouns in order to
  facilitate comparison of different versions of a text using the proper 
  nouns as markers. Text segmentation means that multi-character words are
  grouped together from the stream of Chinese characters. This is a point of
  difficulty for non-native Chinese speakers because Chinese text has no
  spaces. It may be useful to native Chinese speakers as well because of the
  large number of multi-character words of Sanskrit origin in the canon.

  The Chinese text reader
  for the Taishō was generated using a freely available tool
  <a
  href="https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com/tree/master/go/src/cnreader"
  title="Command line tool on GitHub">cnreader</a>. The HTML pages generated
  were uploaded to this web site to be available to web users. The source of the
  texts is the <a href='http://cbeta.org/'>CBETA</a> web site, which distributes
  the texts freely under a <a 
  href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/tw/'>Creative
  Commons</a> license. The NTI Reader Project is very thankful to CEBTA for this
  wonderful contribution to the general public and subsequently makes the 
  content of the NTI Reader freely available under an English version of the 
  same license.
</p>
<p>
  The cnreader tool analyzes all the text files making up volumes 1-55 of the
  Taishō, does text segmentation to find the words with the stream of
  characters, and generates HTML files with links for each word to a 
  Chinese-English word definition. A user can mouse over a word to see a brief
  defintion and can click on the word for the full detail on a separate HTML
  page.

<p>
  The collection of texts in this web site are managed as a <i>text corpus</i>.
  A text <i>corpus</i> is a term used in linguistics to 
  mean a representative collection of texts used to 
  study the linguistic characteristics of a language. The Brown Corpus, first 
  published in 1961 [Francis 1964], was the first large corpus developed.
  It consists of about 1 million English words.
  The corpus of Chinese texts from the Taishō used on this site has 59,069,881
  words with 33,200 unique words and 73,414,250 characters, according the 
  summary of the <a href='analysis/corpus_analysis.html'>Corpus Analysis</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Each corpus entry includes meta data about a primary source document, such as
  the source and links to plain text versions, English translations, vocabulary
  analysis, and other information.
  Each corpus entry has a text file that uses a markdown file. Markdown is a plain
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> can allow people who are not 
  software or web design specialists to easily work with plain text that can be transformed
  to HTML later. Markdown consists of simple and intuitive patterns, such has headers and 
  bullet lists for making plan text more readable.  This makes it easy to add annotations to
  primary source documents or copies of them.
</p>
<p>
  The collection of primary texts and markdown documents is through a set of 
  tab separated variable files.
